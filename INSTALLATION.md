This is only tested on Windows 10, but Unity is pretty good about cross-platform so it probably works on Mac, too.

# Installation

1. [Install Unity 2017.4.31f1 (64-bit). ](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive). I don't see any reason why Anodyne 2 wouldn't work in a newer Unity version or Mac OSX, but just FYI it's only ever been tested in this version.
2. Optionally, purchase and download ReWired if you want to re-integrate controller support
3. That's it. Wow!

# Building the Game
1. This is only necessary if you want to export your own versions, mods, etc.
2. Open Build Settings (Ctrl Shift B), ensure all 62 scenes are there and checked. 
3. Change the Player Settings if you want to.
4. Hit Build!
