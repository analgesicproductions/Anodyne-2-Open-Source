x side text to jump info

Jack jumps towards Nova’s position jump after jump. Each time he hits the ground, a kirby-esque impact/rubble star is formed temporarily before vanishing. That is the only ammo. (still have to pull punches) (between jumps Jack recovers on the ground for a while)


Jack shoots nova with extra large hatchet (NEED SPRITE? Or maybe just overscaling the regular one would be funnier). Nova deflects (this time pressing dodge does a special spin deflection animation instead of the “hit” animation). You have to hit it back and forth enough times to trigger ending where you are interrupted by “the center”
