EW: Good afternoon, and welcome to Wosch Car Wash! I am the Eponymous Wosch! No doubt you have traveled far for a taste of our world famous amenities, am I right? Deep tissue scrubbing to ease your aches and pains... a gentle rinse in the ambrosian cascade... and to finish: a luxurious, plush toweling!
EW: Or... that’s what I would say, if we had power. Alas! Our generator is on the fritz and my assistant seems to have misplaced the ladder...

//2 repeat before carwash on
EW: Hello again, Nova. With a heavy heart, I must inform you that our generator is still nonfunctional. If only there were a way to climb up there and give it a jolt!

//3 repeat after carwash on
EW: Oh, the power is back on! Was this your doing, Nova? I hereby declare you a Friend of Wosch Car Wash. Such is my prerogative, as the Eponymous Wosch! Now, might I interest you in the Complete Wosch Experience: A Rejuvenation of the Body and Spirit? On the house!

//4 while Nova is hurt before dustbound
EW: Ah... Nova, Friend of Wosch Car Wash... you are looking a bit unwell. Is there anything I can do for you? Ah, I see... some problems are beyond even the power of a first-rate car wash to remedy...

Eldi:n These hills get bigger every year! Now, I just can't make the walk anymore...
Eldi:n I always told myself, distance is no bother! I can make the hike through the hills! It's no problem if it means seeing my dear friend. And yet, life conspires, once again, to separate us. First, different schools. Then, different jobs, and then, different places to live.
Eldi:n Nova, I know you must be busy, but if you have the chance, could you bring this package to my dear friend? She lives on the outskirts of a farming village, a bit outside of Cenote. She'll be in her home. 
Nova received a neatly-tied package with a cream-colored bow.
Eldi:n Once you deliver it, please let me know! Thank you so much!
// Repeat
Eldi:n Oh, Nova, please bring that package as soon as you can! My friend lives on the outskirts of a farming village. I hope she's doing well...

//Interacting with house without the package
It's just a regular house. The mailbox is stuffed full of mail.

// Interacting after leaving package
... It's the house of Eldi's friend. Nova left a package for her here, but it's still unclaimed. Nova ought to return to Cenote to tell Eldi the news.

// Interacting with package, before leaving it

The lights in the home are off. The door appears unkept, dusty. However, the address is the same as that on the package that Eldi gave to Nova. Nova knocks on the door. 
No reply...
Nova knocks again.

Nothing.
Nova wonders where this friend could be! She notices the mailbox, stuffed full of mail.
She decides to leave the package here, and go tell Eldi the news, who is near the bottom of the elevator in Cenote.

Eldi:n Oh, Nova, you're back! How is my dear friend? Did she serve you one of her fungus tarts? Did she mention the story about her knocking over the pasta sauce shelf in Cenote Market?
Eldi:n Oh... she wasn't there? The mailbox was full? Did you knock? That's strange, indeed...
Eldi:n You know, Nova, I haven't heard from her in a while. Perhaps she moved somewhere else, and began life anew.
Eldi:n It seems that this is the strongest test of a friendship's bonds... yes, perhaps this separation will be the one that never ends. 
Eldi:n Anyways, thank you, Nova. You must be so busy. Please, for your trouble, take this. I hear it might be handy for you.

Nova feels like a piece of her soul has been torn asunder, like something as vital as blood has suddenly vanished from her limbs. What just happened? She cannot make sense of it!! Surely this was a fluke... a faulty projection... a lapse of the mind! It couldn’t mean... no...

After some amount of time (was it minutes or hours?) Nova struggles to her feet, her mind desperately groping to make sense of the images left to her by Palisade.

scene spire-wall-blocked
[FADE]
The Dust Storm that once blocked Cenote now blocks the frontier into the Outer Sands.
Its infectious forces rage and flow, forming a gigantic wall inches away from Nova, so close to snuffing out her life, her responsibility...
[CLEAR]
And yet, in this storm’s chaos is a strange feeling of beauty, of comfort. To Nova, it almost feels like the walls of a home, protecting her and other inhabitants from what lies outside.

Nova wants to go further, but, she knows it would only endanger her mission. The Center holds the key to proceeding further. She must restore its power!

Nova begins to spark the fruit, but...
A wild, dusty beast leaps onto the edge of the plateau and eyes the fruit curiously!

Before Nova can react, the beast bounds forwards and swallows the fruit whole! Nova flushes with anger and embarrassment. If only she had arrived sooner! Now there was only one way she could possibly reach the fruit.

Day after day, I dug. I cleared the fungus, restoring the fields, and yet… people left! They quit! They gave up on our town! Why would life place such curses on me?
The pleas from the other citizens were convincing, but... Nova, now that I am clean, my memory restored, I must listen to my heart. I will carry on the work and clear all this fungus away. One day, I will succeed. Just like you, Nova.

Me and the other snowmen have come from another world. Most of us are just relaxing, but... a few have joined Iwasaki's Fan Cave. I guess... such things are to be expected when travelling far from home.

Brr... I... I-I... am not worthy to leave the snowfield. I must practice my tree sculpting and endure this weather. Iwasaki told me that only when I understand the meaning of a blossoming petal, peeking from snowcaps, will I proceed. Brr... so cold. I haven't seen a single petal for the past week...
Iwasaki and some others suggested I need to improve my tree trimming fundamentals. That I needed to master the basics before I considered getting closer to the temples. But I'm too cold to even hold the trimming scissors... brr...
According to the Fan Cave's trials, I am but a mere C-License Arborealist. My goal? A B-License. I won't have to trudge around here anymore.

//Worshippers outside the tower structure. 4 5
I am an A-License Arborealist, nearly ready to enter the Master's grounds. Only a few have the S-License to enter. Like Iwasaki. Oh, beautiful Iwasaki! How his dedication to the trees shines. He is a man of worth for these sacred grounds.
Out of the S-License Arborealists, clearly Iwasaki is the strongest. I aspire to be like him, and yet… I have not even read 'Grimoire Bark'. Excuse me, I must continue my studies.

//Worshippers after returning from 3D, near the crystal 6

Maple A.:n Ho-ho! Welcome to the Fan Cave! We study the work of the Tree Master. Today we're showing a gallery of our members' finest trees. That large tree was done by none other than the club leader, Iwasaki. The detailing is divine! When I drift to sleep, I wonder if I'll ever reach that level of skill... sigh.

Newspapers neatly lay in a pile. A "best father" magnet adorns their fridge. A small, neatly trimmed tree sits in a pot near the person. Further into the home, Nova could see some larger trees, each with an exquisite flair.

FM: Ahhh... it’s good to be back home... I wonder how ol’ Lonwei’s doing... Oh, hi there! Are you a new resident of the valley? Oh right, you’re the Nano Cleaner! I guess we both came here from Cenote. For a while, I was scraping by in the big city as the frontwoman of a band, but then my parents left for travel and wanted me to take care of the house.
FM: Have you seen Lonwei? She’s the scientist who lives up the big steps. We fell out of touch when I moved, but I still think about her sometimes. One time she used her chemistry set to mix up some sort of concoction for me to spike my hair! Hahaha...
FM: What’s it like to be a rockstar? Ah... hahaha. It’s pretty fun overall. I’m lucky. I don’t really have a lot of basis for comparison. It can be a lot of pressure, but I never really thought I could be anything else, so... I’m glad to be back home for a spell, though. Missed hearing the sounds of birds.
FM: Even if you are very familiar with someone’s artistic work, it doesn’t mean you totally know them. On the other hand, even if you know someone personally you don’t always “know” them either. I guess there are just different ways of knowing. Imagining the interiority of another person is always part projection, but that’s not necessarily bad.

RB: Nova!! Say you were shrunken down and found a dust mite... if you put the dust mite in your mouth and then grow back to full size, would you then have a GIANT dust mite in your mouth? Oops, is that a rude question to ask? I would just love to see a giant dust mite...
RB: Nova, are you a gamer? Did you know that videogames can make you cry? Oh, you are physically unable to cry? Ah, I’m sorry, Nova, I did not mean to be insensitive! But videogames can be a very emotional experience. My favorite videogame is called “An Ode to Dyin”, it is very sad.
RB: Nova, would you like to have a thermometer? It could help you to determine if you have a fever or sometimes it’s just fun to hold to see how cold your hand is! I realized that I didn’t have a thermometer so I went to order one. It was a much better deal to get a 12-pack of thermometers than to buy a single one. But then they arrived and I thought: what am I going to do with 12 thermometers?

BM: Bum... ba-dum... ba-dum-ba-dum... Oh, excuse me, I was just working out a new beat. I am Beringia and this is my drumbird Katsu! Together we travel New Theland, but somehow we always find ourselves back here in the valley...
BM: Hmm, you keep looking toward the building on the steps. That is Lonwei Yonstein’s laboratory. I couldn’t say I know much of Lonwei, but I want her to be happy. She stays up there mostly, smoke and fumes swirling up from her chimneys until late into the night. Most often, I run into her at the pond. She leaves little contraptions in the water and checks them day after day.
BM: If you travel further from The Center in any direction, you’ll find the Outer Sands. Further still to meet the sea. Past the sea is the horizon, but the horizon can only be seen and not touched. Is there anything more than all of this?
BM: Drumbirds are incredibly hardy creatures. Not only does Katsu relish being pounded upon with wooden sticks, but they also have sheltered me from extreme heat and cold throughout our travels. I don’t know where I’d be without Katsu.

LY: Ah, Nova, you have arrived at last! That is to say... greetings, it is good to see you! I am Lonwei Yonstein, PhD, and this is my... er... brother, Clonwei Yonstein. 
CY: ...
LY: Clonwei, to be honest, is the one you are really here to see! But don’t let him get a “big head” about it... Ha ha ha ha! He loves that joke, don’t you Clonwei?
CY: ...
LY: Nova, have you ever met a “PhD” before? It means that I am a Doctor of Phil. Ah, but despite my impressive credentials, I still require the assistance of a Nano Cleaner! Clonwei is sick with the Dust... I can observe the sickness with my Nano Drone, but I am unable to truly clean him!
LY: Please Nova... I can feel his pain! Please... help my brother Clonwei!!

scene clone-enter
$LY$: Nova, it’s me, Lonwei Yonstein, PhD, communicating with you via my Nano Drone! I thought I might be able to assist you, as I am familiar with Clonwei’s mindscape. You see, Clonwei has the ability to create shadow beings within this realm. You may need to use this to your advantage...

__c1 $CY$: Oh yeah, haha, that's neat!
__c2 $RB$: Wow, you must be so smart! I hear you are a scientist?? What are your favorite colors of bubbling liquids to put in your test tubes??
__c1 $CY$: Er, well, that's not really how science works... (Wow... this Rayray character really thinks I'm something. But I'm just a huge dork idiot... Rayray must be an even bigger dork if she looks up to *me*!)

__c2 $BM$: Oh yeah I'm sorry, Clonwei. What's up?
__c1 $CY$: I was just wondering if you wanted to go visit the Radish fields in the west some time? I hear they're beautiful. Er, I mean, like together with me that is...
__c2 $BM$: Oh um... you and me? Like on a date?
__c1 $CY$: Oh haha, I dunno. I mean... If you...
__c2 $BM$: Uh. Look Clonwei... Uh. You're a really neat person! But... Uh... I guess I never thought of you as the dating type! You’re always just working in your lab... Have you ever dated anyone before?

$LY$: Ah, never mind, Nova. We’re almost to the Dust Crystal... after Clonwei is cleaned, he’ll stop playing out these goofy scenarios over and over again.

$LY$: AHH!! Okay! I must come clean!! Clonwei is not my brother! He is a machine I created to compute the outcome of interactions. I... I intentionally grew the Dust inside of him to power his highly complex software!! The serum I used to grow the Dust must have mutated its chemical structure, and now it is resistant to transformation!!

$LY$: Er... Nova... try sucking up my Nano Drone as well! Perhaps I can strategically perforate the Dust Crystal from inside your vacuum canister!

LY: Nova... because of my deception, you were put in harm’s way. For that, I deeply apologize... I was afraid that if The Center found out about my experiments with Dust, my laboratory would be shut down. But believe me, Nova: never again will I tamper with these forces... they are beyond my control.
LY: No... from now on, I will stick to what I know and understand. Why set myself up for failure and embarrassment? Some pursuits are simply not worthwhile... some experiments will only cause harm...

scene clone-after
LY: I allowed myself to get distracted by the Clonwei experiment. I should return to my original, Center-assigned research topic: Dream energy. Did you know that one of the most powerful forms of energy in existence is human yearning?
LY: I wonder what the power of human yearning could create...
LY: I am very grateful to be the type of person who deserves to be created with a PhD. Not everyone deserves to have been created with a PhD, or else they would have been.

Dolphfan Sr.:n Ahh... Nova the Nano Cleaner. Enjoying your work? Wonderful, wonderful. Can't find those cards? Well, I, a Hintline Specialist, am happy to provide my services for free!
Dolphfan Sr.:n Hmm... you might want to find more people to clean! As us Hintline Specialists say: "Ganbatte! Ganbatte! Never give up!"
Dolphfan Sr.:n Don't forget where I am, now! Here's a mnemonic: "D.N.C.". It means: "Dolphins Never Cry." It can also mean, "Dolphin Near Carwash".
Dolphfan Sr.:n My patented card radar says you overlooked something in Geof Agricite! Why don't you head on over there again?
Dolphfan Sr.:n My company-loaned cardguide says you may want to look in Blue Vale East! Something about an "arch entrance" and "rocks", too.
Dolphfan Sr.:n My cardolocation powers tell me Iwasaki Antimon has what you need!
Dolphfan Sr.:n Oh, Nova... it's you... The Metaclean Framework put me out of business... hint sales are down across the board... no use for an old Hintline Specialist like me... *sniff* I heard that now your map shows you missing cards... what's the fun in that?? I bet that Metashop even sells some lousy old Card Detector or something, too... *sniff*
Dolphfan Sr.:n But you don't need my help, it seems! Well, thanks for paying me a visit!
Dolphfan Sr.:n My company-loaned cardguide says you want to look around Blue Vale South!

Dolphfan Sr.:n Hmm... I feel a card very very close to us right now!! Something related to that carwash!
