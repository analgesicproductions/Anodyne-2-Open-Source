	<l>Dear Player,</l>
	<l>Thank you for playing Anodyne 2: Return to Dust. It is somewhat of a spiritual successor - it has narrative and thematic ties to the first Anodyne, but features a completely new world and characters. That is to say, the two games can be enjoyed in any order.</l>
	<l>At times, the world of Anodyne 2 may be a strange or confusing place. But! At its heart is a story of human struggles and relationships.</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>Now! </l>
	<l>Come on!</l>
	<l>Let's go on a curious and wonderful journey together!</l>

	<l>A special, protective card given by Palisade, for use in a time of need.</l>
	<l>Gustine Papellum\nMuch of what we perceive as "taste" is actually olfactory in nature. Perhaps now I can fully appreciate the smellscape of New Theland! ...or will that also function as a gateway to depravity?</l>
	<l>Great Gwom\nAs the Aughur, I am a proud practioner of "Cold Reading". It is like "Hot Yoga" but more intellectual.</l>
	<l>Misteria Waizel\nThe body is like a lampshade. Our true light is constrained and dimmed by our physical forms, and yet... these same forms allow us to look at and touch each other! Life is a cruel joke...</l>
	<l>Bran Maligden\nTrue peace comes from within. It's foolish to ask the world around you to change to suit your desires. The only thing you can control is your own feelings.</l>
	<l>Geof Agricite\nIf you dig 99 times and only find dirt, don't quit! Some other fellow's gonna come by and find your treasure...  ha ha! Don't worry -- you've gotta believe!</l>
	<l>Geof's Village\nThe real estate values have been constantly driven down by nothing more than a "natural" disaster.</l>
	<l>Lonwei\nYou can learn everything through the power of imagination!\nClonwei\n...</l>
	<l>Help!! I'm trapped in a flavor text factory! All day long I write humorous little blurbs for your reading pleasure—but at what cost?? Well... for the first time in many years, the reclusive proprietor of this diabolical establishment is opening the factory to a select few outside guests. This... this is my chance...</l>
	<l>Iwasaki Antimon\nOver time, bio-trees have become rare in New Theland. We tree sculptors have risen up to fill the void. A sculpted tree is different from a bio-tree in that it is suffused with the power of human choice.</l>
	<l>The Arborealist rank system is a form of hope incarnate. We must reach ever higher, as the proverbial tree. We must follow those who we know to stand above us. And in the end, we will be rewarded. A C-Licenser is overwhelmingly marked by artificiality. A B-Licenser is self-consistent, but lacking perfection. A-Licensers create work indistinguishable from Bio-Trees. And an S-Licenser... transcends the concept of Tree.</l>
	<l>The Eponymous Wosch\nA carwash is a liminal space, at once both interior (enclosed by wall and roof) and exterior (paved road, suitable for cars). A carwash is a sacred space, a link between the mundane and the divine.</l>
	<l>Jade Highway\nIt's either my way or the highway! ...Oh wait, my way IS the highway! Ahahaha!! I presented you with a false choice in order to appease your ego... all the while, you stayed completely within my control! Ahahahaha!!!</l>
	<l>Minorma\nOnwards!! Upwards!! Skywards!! A world without expansion is one without a future. How can you seriously believe anything else? My plan will succeed! All will know the beauty of the Orb!</l>
	<l>Fabrahem\nFa-sha-sha! The power of fashion is meant for all walks of life. We must unleash our fashion storms and show our inner beauties!</l>
	<l>Loquat\nHave you ever been a home? If I may be frank, it is at times quite disturbing. But what is life if one is not relied upon?</l>
	<l>Gum Key\nWe finish each other's—\nSkel Key\n—sadnesses!</l>
	<l>New Theeland Map\nOh Hello! Remember Reading Printouts of Game Creation Explanation?</l>
	<l>Pilar Treacl\nAh, how good and clean it feels, to be a person who has never mourned! I eat only broccoli now, and other cultivars of the species Brassica Oleracea.</l>
	<l>In the past, small children were bitten by snakes in the desert at night. That was before <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> regained narrative influence in the Outer Sands.</l>
	<l>Tremuloid\nWhat are the boundaries of an organism? What is the limit of a body? Are we a cell, an organ, a body, a community?? Father's way is insufficient... WE MUST DEFINE OUR OWN STRUCTURE!</l>
	<l>(Unreadable)</l>
	<l>Amago\nI lived between two worlds! How tragic! And yet, I must not wallow in my individual sadness. Many of us live between two worlds. Why are we forced to do so? What controls the Pastel Horizon, and delineates the ways of living?</l>
	<l>Fukuchi\nMy mother used to tell a story about me as a child. No matter which toy I had, I would always reach for a different one. I was always afraid to miss out. What can I say? I want everything, and maybe one day that will lead to nothingness. It's the price I pay.</l>
	<l>Bridgebuilder\nWhat do I do, now that the bridge is complete? Hahaha... a ghost bridge is never complete... I build as a way of living, knowing that perhaps the work extends beyond my life.</l>
	<l>A special card from Palisade. After Nova landed in <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dustbound<![CDATA[</color>]]> Village, Drem Kinako tore this up (and has since taped it back together.) It has no protective use anymore.</l>

	<l>Pashmina, pashman, do you see the craftan? A dog with eyes the size of towers, a cat with tongue the length of air. Why do we reach out and find so little left to us? Why is the center hollow, the bagel wrapped in barnacles. Do everything bagels contain a kitchen sink in which to wash off all of the shame of their excess? Can I please, may I please, elevate myself to the point of grass, I'm a worm, I'm a carrot, I'm a stick. I'm myself at the end of my own tether, reaching out for who I am and was and will be. I'll ask over and over again like an fool, to be seen by her, the fragrant one, and she won't be able to understand what I'm saying. Won't be able to hear me. It's like I'm speaking through a stained glass window. I'm a soft and blurry shape, shadows behind the form of Jesus. A sermon on the mount of meaningless shadow puppet shows. And now the radiators, too hot to touch, steam and yowl and dare the irridescent irradiated wasteland of my mind.</l>
	<l>Jalopia tendon twine. In the mirror I can see a felled wimple tree, skin peeling like a dropped dog, a temper coronary. Bicalutamide tricks and porridge twicks, snap the marketing research into delectable crisplings. What if the torror pore comes too soon, what if the ley lines inhabit my tremor? Deinstantiating everything long gone from my eyesight. The culling of frustum the sheep from the flock, the sick and the old are reduced to cracklings.\n...\nCopy me, paste me, redirect my tween frames into forbidden distinction and ruin my animation in hidden secret moments stolen from the gods.</l>
	<l>The sky was beautiful tonight, like damp drops of dungarees, and small white rabbits huddled in the crook of a root. Why do gates deteriorate, many years after the pies have all fallen off the windowsills and the golden hour has faded from your teeth. The bits of poop in the piles of autumn leaves will always leave a mark. Why is there a powerline shoved between your molars, freeing you from bits of plaque and celery tendons. Bloviating masses irradiate the small french hen with a sheen of microwavery goodness. Won't a good child dispel that magic? Remove those ripples from the realm of space until all meat is raw once more. Back in the days when we spent all of our time chewing. Please be gracious, please be kind. When you meet the small disgraced villain, the empty slobbering mess, take pity on the poor soul. The pure evil. The tattered and frayed.\n...\nNova's a girl, confused. she doesn't know anything. She's bound to fate. She like to eat creme brule. She wishes that her love for stuffed animals was truer. She forgets if she was ever happy, but is okay for now. She lingers, nothing is ever enough.</l>
	<l>Welcome. It's a new year, it's a new heart. Crackle and creak upon the fresh fiber floorboards. Raisins and regularity. If we deepen the salt flats and the salt wounds, can we preserve ourselves in this sorry state? Can we desperately cling to our jerky selves, our jerkied hearts. Christen me newly, sprinkle oil on my head. The jimmies and whipped cream and lockpicks and mousepads. Fluoridate my fountain, Marisol. Shelter me from sunlight parasol. There is a watering can that pours only into a trough. There are rows and rows of animals that berate me. I was born into their feeding box but they were not allowed to eat me.\n...\nEverything I touch turns to continuity.</l>
	<l>In Anodyne 2 the little nano will perch upon the windowsill. Like a small bug she will cry to be let into her death zone. There is nothing for you here but an artificial distinction beyond your understanding. There is a mole in the hallway. He eats the endless dirt in a small cake. Saucer and teacup before the fire. There is an endless array of park benches of pork dumplings filled with dirt. There is a worm sauce. There is rain and raindrops spilling into buckets. If you ever come back here again, I swear to god. There is nothing left in this newspaper. The newspaper must be clean. As the articles disappear so does our pain.\n...\nPlay with scale. Will there ever stop being structure? All the way down, all the way down. Why can't we see something end? When will the crust break off. Why can't the blankey cover the universe? Why is the pie cooling on the windowsill? What will we give to be human? </l>
	<l>Nevertheless, when the two boys walk to the fried temple walkway, their arteries will swell with the bellows of seventy grams of unhealthy trans fat. Tubules of walkways swoop around in places unbeknownest to their mothers. Red and yellow colors of the rainbow and rainforest make their way backwardsly to the place of no return. And the place that they go will be next to the young world of temple places of forest temple heaven sky. In the sky is a hole that is beautiful. And in the sky that is beautiful is no one at all. No one but the spirits of the graves. Of the fireflies and potato lords. People who own the farms, run the prisons. Lotion won't get in their way, nothing will as they look to run their farms and destroy the peasant workers.</l>

	<l>An audio log. It says: "I found myself in a vast, white space. A drawer-like structure connects this space to The Land. Where do the other drawers go? Are there other Lands? Are they decayed? Is Young there? I walked for a long time as I pondered these questions. Some residents of The Land followed me mindlessly, clearly not their former selves. I suspect it's a matter of their distance to Young, since their decay began after Young left. I soon found that with my new Tool, I could manifest tunnels, passageways, sometimes debris - by pulling at the air itself. Eventually, I dug a tunnel into what was a dark void. At times I was hesitant, but... Young's connection gave me willpower as I lost my way. A rope leading out of the cave. I tumbled down and down this void, realizing the white expanse was only the peak of an endless mountain, a deep abyss. But finally, I've found soil. Whether it manifested to me or existed already I didn't know. But now, with my willpower... a new land can begin.</l>
	<l>An audio log. It says: "I no longer feel their connection, but it doesn't matter anymore! I made this island, and one day, one day, they will return."</l>

	<l>Truly, Cenote is a testament to our ability to deliver prime spatial experiences. Despite the difficulty of filling a giant hole, Cenote still feels complete. Was it expensive? Sure. Was it time consuming? Perhaps. But with this experience in hand, we now know how to increase our future efficiency.</l>
	<l>You might look at this elevator, and see a simple object that doesn't even move. But to do that would be looking past our true intent: simplifying the often complicated elevator experience. By utilizing teleportation tech, we can move you from Cenote to the Blue Vale in mere seconds. Isn't that better than waiting for 15 seconds?</l>
	<l>By allowing requiring someone to use these roofs to climb up to Gustine, we've utilized the 'layered level' technique. This new technology enables us to create multi-tiered places which, on a second glance, endow you with a deeper understanding of what seemed to be mere set dressing.</l>
	<l>We understand the difficulty of high walls: they block your view, making navigation difficult. Such a pain! That's why we widened the walls leading up to The Aughur, and even added some signs that our harshest critics might call 'unsubtle'. But: they served their purpose, and that is truly what matters!</l>
	<l>When it comes to large spaces, we know it would take far too long to walk around. However, walking around is a necessary feature when exploring the smaller areas of New Theland. That's why we developed 'Ridescale', a novel transportation solution. No longer do the creators of today need to rely on old concepts such as 'having to whistle for your horse or car' - we've jumped into the future and brought 'instant car transformation' right to your doorstep!</l>
	<l>A circular road incorporates the 'omnidirectional vision' philosophy, wherein we can scatter multiple landmarks for you to remember. When you want to visit one, merely look for the land mark, and drive your way around to it! How simple, how divine!</l>
	<l>A bird's eye view into the void. Truly a visual treat for the ages. But not only that, but by framing the camera, not only did we create visual drama and anticipation, but we've been able to save time on only having to think about the area being seen from a single angle. Budget and efficiency is the path to innovation!</l>

	<l>A stunning view. You'll be pleased to know, the Cenote below you is modeled in 1:1 size as the Cenote you've explored. All we had to do was use a time-tested technique: the copy paste. By keeping Cenote visible, we've cued you in on to the relative scale of the world of New Theland. We also saved money.</l>
	<l>Which way is the right way to go? Ha! There is no wrong way. With the 'dual exit roadway', we've encouraged exploration through all directions of New Theland. Wander freely!</l>
	<l>Doesn't this strange village immediately grab your interest? Environmental designs such as these enable us to spark our storytelling by creating a level shape that we combine with narrative themes such as 'arrogance' and 'overwork'. The two - writing and level - work hand in hand to produce the Nanopoint you explored.</l>
	<l>Ah, Blue Vale East is truly a sprawling area. But through the use of landmarks, you'll always know where you're going! The trees lead towards the woods! The rocky hill path leads towards Cenote! The highway leads to the South! And so on. With the power of landmarks and being able to easily see from one landmark to another, navigation becomes easier.</l>
	<l>Our design concept for this area was 'gliding over a canyon'. We wanted to give you the feeling of truly being 'high up on the highway', and be able to look down below. Many areas in New Theland start with this kind of base spatial concept.</l>
	<l>To spice things up, we divide the location of cards between those in Nanopoints and those in 3D. This is one example of 'breaking the pattern of expectation' in which we tweak an established pattern so that exploration becomes more intriguing. You wouldn't just want a single room with 10 NPCs and 10 <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Cards<![CDATA[</color>]]>, right?</l>
	<l>A carwash? Or a playground? Yes, our designers considered the 'duality of the space' once again here, as this carwash is both an area that acts as gateway into the Geof's Village area, as well as a structure you can climb around and explore. We call this the 'delight of the 3D model', in how simply a simple structure can also become something one may explore.</l>
	<l>This area cost a few days to create. And yet... bask in its beauty. Does this orb of branches not make you wonder who created it! Yes, yes... in the creation of New Theland, physics and 'realism' know no bounds. Our motto is "let the imagination fly and take you to the moon," as well as "please don't complain about minor visual problems to me."</l>
	<l>You may be asking, "Why does the lower portion of this gate look weird and stretched instead of like normal bricks?" I doubt you would understand the true technical answer, which involves "UV" (Ultra Violet) maps. I guess you could say, we were planning on the gates being shorter at first, and when we decided to make a taller version of the gate, we didn't feel like getting more bricks. So we stretched out the bricks with our patented "no-work" technique, and thus was born the beautiful and unique patterning you see before you today!</l>
	<l>The world of New Theland is all about playing with scale. Take a closer look at these cattails! They are no normal cattails. Ahahahah! They are designed after the single-celled life forms "radiolarians", which are known for their elaborate mineral skeletons! Perhaps you have seen famous drawings of radiolarians before in an illustrated encyclopedia? The illustrator was a bad person, and we shall not name them!</l>

	<l>You may be interested to know that the mountain before you and the one you stand on after going up the cave are not the same! In fact, we created two mountains of differing sizes because of how perspective distorts tall objects. Yes... that is what we want you to believe, but actually the store ran out of spires and we had to buy a defective misshapen one!</l>
	<l>As we created a desert, we faced the problem: how do you get from one area to another? Well, our designers figured the best way would be having a subtle and literal gate around the whole place. It combines visibility with subtlety, and, yes - even allows you to easily create lines of sight towards the gates that take you to other areas. Some might call it 'inelegant', however, we don't see them creating entire worlds in a single year.</l>
	<l>Why, look who we have here! Indeed, the "out of bounds" is as much as an important space as the "in bounds". You may enjoy seeing the world of New Theland from different, strange, perhaps even profane angles when you travel "out of bounds!" Be careful!</l>
	<l>Is there anything more stunning than a beach? It is an exterior, the outer limit of a place. It defines the unknown, a border in which you may not cross. And as you draw your eyes to the horizon, perhaps you will even notice a nearby place you'd like to explore. Yes, yes. Or perhaps, we just liked pretty beaches...</l>
	<l>Misdirection is a fun concept to play with. Throw any sense of 'logical mechanic development' out the door, and instead, break patterns with world creation! We hope you enjoyed the strangeness of entering this random object and finding a vast, 2D world. </l>
	<l>While creating this field, our designers used field research to build a library of reference photos. Then, we attempted to construct the illusion of you moving down a large hill, by creating another large hill in the distance. The result is an expansive feeling space full of hills and troughs!</l>
	<l>Our designers love to play with different shaped spaces, but also, lighting is a fun idea to play with. Instead of having 'dynamic' day and night cycles, we consolidate all of our energies for maximum synergy, and focus on one lighting condition per area. That lets us carefully curate the perfect mood for exploration. It also lets us save time and money. You only live once.</l>
	<l>History speaks of many important towers: The Windmill... The Sunray Spire... and now this... the Desert Spire. What makes towers such a potent symbol, such a recurring theme in all great art? I don't know. Don't overthink it!!!</l>
	<l>Hmm... these gateways look familiar! I don't remember why. Probably because they are an example of a "perfect shape", one that must inevitably come into existence based on the very properties of atoms and so forth. </l>
	<l>The Tremuloids in this area are inspired by Pando, a giant clonal colony of quaking aspen tree, thought to be the heaviest single living organism. Pando is located in Utah. What's Utah? Er... well... Utah exists in what we might call a "fantasy world". Fantasy worlds exist outside of the dominion of <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> and are not really True or relevant, but sometimes they can be fun and edifying to think about!</l>
	<l>This entire rocky cliff is made of 15 duplicates of a single rocky shape. Through the powers of "Rotation" and "Stretching" we have fooled you into thinking that this is a beautiful and natural cliff face such as has been shaped over eons by wind and rain!</l>
	<l>Have you ever noticed that sometimes the tall grasses will pop into existence specifically as you approach them? It takes a lot of extra computing power to turn on and off all these individual pieces of grass, but its worth it to convey the feeling that this world was made for your personal enjoyment!</l>

	<l pic="PAL">Welcome to Center City Cenote, a vibrant community built into the walls of this sacred geological depression! Directly above Center Sanctuary is the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust Prism<![CDATA[</color>]]>, which stores the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Nano Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> you will collect.</l>
	<l pic="PAL">You may use the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust Drop Console<![CDATA[</color>]]> in Center Sanctuary to deposit <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]>. Once sealed within the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust Prism<![CDATA[</color>]]>, the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Nano Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> may blossom to its full scale without harming New Theland! Once enough <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> is accumulated in the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust Prism<![CDATA[</color>]]>, it will be sent to <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> to be recycled into energy.</l>
	<l pic="PAL">But alas! Before you were born, the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust Prism<![CDATA[</color>]]> was damaged in a terrible storm, and now it can only contain a small fraction of its full <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> capacity! Because of this energy shortage, the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]>'s dominion has advanced to the point where it is no longer safe to leave the city! You can see the storm still raging overhead...</l>
	<l pic="PAL">This is where you come in, Nova! The <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust Prism<![CDATA[</color>]]> can be reinforced with rare and powerful <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Cards<![CDATA[</color>]]> that you can find while Nano Cleaning. Your first goal is to reinforce the Prism with 4 <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Cards<![CDATA[</color>]]> and fill it with 100cc <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Nano Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]>. Then <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> will be able to recycle the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> into energy and push back the storm, allowing you to leave Center City Cenote!</l>
	<l pic="PAL">To sum it up, your mission is to search the city for people in need of cleaning, collect the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> and <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Cards<![CDATA[</color>]]> inside of them, then deposit those resources back in Center Sanctuary. Check your progress on the Menu by pressing {PAUSE}. You're going to do an amazing job, Nova!</l>

	<l>The heaving beast, Bran Maligden, screams at Nova, but screaming is not enough. She stomps the platform and pounds her fists, rattling the skeletal structure around her. </l>
	<l>Nova stands frozen in terror. Is she going about this "Nano Cleaning" business all wrong? Nova feels ashamed for making Bran so angry, for not approaching more tactfully. She wonders if maybe <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> was wrong to trust her with such an important task...</l>
	<l>Suddenly... CRASH!!!</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>A slab of concrete falls from above, breaking into pieces across the creature's head.</l>
	<l>"You think that's pretty funny, don't you?!!" Bran screams. "DING DONG the Wicked Witch is CRUSHED"!! AHAHAH!! I got what I deserved, THAT's what you're thinking!!"</l>
	<l>Nova cannot imagine anything less funny than Bran Maligden's pain. But maybe Bran can see something about Nova that she herself cannot. Perhaps there is an ugliness inside of Nova that she has not yet learned to recognize...</l>
	<l>"I need help..." Bran Maligden says, suddenly, quietly. "Please... clean me."</l>

	<l>Bran Maligden: Where did the anger begin? It's impossible to say. But if the Dust had not arrived, I would never have reached this point, drowning in my own rage. Like a soft buzzing sound or a faint red light, slowly growing in intensity, I was hardly aware of what was happening until it was too late. Then I felt like there was nothing I could do but scream and shake.</l>
	<l>I became so foul and ugly in my rage. Thank you, Nova, for helping me to find peace.</l>

	<l>Nova turns to see Misteria Waizel's head rise from beneath the bedcovers. The weary figure continues to expel harsh wet coughs. Nova bows her head in shame and glances around frantically. It is difficult to say what mess she may have caused, so she begins to shuffle about, attempting to tidy the room generally.</l>

	<l>The great squirming creature hangs its head, and speaks in a low rumble. "Ohhh... the mud feels cool and calming to our skin, prickled as we are by fever and eczema."</l>

	<l>After a long ride to the top of Cenote, Nova exits the elevator and steps onto a wide, circular platform, built from white material she saw in Cenote. To the north and south are two big bridges. Instinctually, she picks the northern bridge, and crosses it.</l>
	<l>Urban sounds fade away, leaving a gentle breeze and rustling grass. Hills and mountains of deep blue fill the horizon, pulling her attention in all directions. It feels... different.</l>
	<l>Gazing at these sights, Nova can't help but feel a strange feeling deep inside her chest, something almost pulling her downward, easing her senses into the blue soil. Was this peace? Happiness?</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>N... No. It couldn't be. She remembered what C Psalmist had told her. Though the blue sky and distant mountains appeared calm and inviting, Nova knew that the stillness in the air was deceiving - a trick. It was merely a facade, as somewhere out here, <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Nano Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> was growing. Threatening to consume the world.</l>
	<l>Her new feeling - it must be a new kind of fear.</l>
	<l>Right?</l>
	<l>There's no time to relax - Nova knows this. She must work. She must clean. She must seek out every infected person in these mountains and protect them...</l>

	<l pic="FM">Ahhh... it's good to be back home... I wonder how ol' Lonwei's doing... Oh, hi there! Are you a new resident of the valley? Oh right, you're the Nano Cleaner! I guess we both came here from Cenote. For a while, I was scraping by in the big city as the frontwoman of a band, but then my parents left for travel and wanted me to take care of the house.</l>
	<l pic="FM">Have you seen Lonwei? She's the scientist who lives up the big steps. We fell out of touch when I moved, but I still think about her sometimes. One time she used her chemistry set to mix up some sort of concoction for me to spike my hair! Hahaha...</l>
	<l pic="FM">What's it like to be a rockstar? Ah... hahaha. It's pretty fun overall. I'm lucky. I don't really have a lot of basis for comparison. It can be a lot of pressure, but I never really thought I could be anything else, so... I'm glad to be back home for a spell, though. Missed hearing the sounds of birds.</l>
	<l pic="FM">Even if you are very familiar with someone's artistic work, it doesn't mean you totally know them. On the other hand, even if you know someone personally you don't always "know" them either. I guess there are just different ways of knowing. Imagining the interiority of another person is always part projection, but that's not necessarily bad.</l>

	<l pic="RB">Nova!! Say you were shrunken down and found a dust mite... if you put the dust mite in your mouth and then grow back to full size, would you then have a GIANT dust mite in your mouth? Oops, is that a rude question to ask? I would just love to see a giant dust mite...</l>
	<l pic="RB">Nova, are you a gamer? Did you know that videogames can make you cry? Oh, you are physically unable to cry? Ah, I'm sorry, Nova, I did not mean to be insensitive! But videogames can be a very emotional experience. My favorite videogame is called "An Ode to Dyin", it is very sad.</l>
	<l pic="RB">Nova, would you like to have a thermometer? It could help you to determine if you have a fever or sometimes it's just fun to hold to see how cold your hand is! I realized that I didn't have a thermometer so I went to order one. It was a much better deal to get a 12-pack of thermometers than to buy a single one. But then they arrived and I thought: what am I going to do with 12 thermometers?</l>

	<l pic="BM">Hmm, you keep looking toward the building on the steps. That is Lonwei Yonstein's laboratory. I couldn't say I know much of Lonwei, but I want her to be happy. She stays up there mostly, smoke and fumes swirling up from her chimneys until late into the night. Most often, I run into her at the pond. She leaves little contraptions in the water and checks them day after day.</l>
	<l pic="BM">If you travel further from <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> in any direction, you'll find the Outer Sands. Further still to meet the sea. Past the sea is the horizon, but the horizon can only be seen and not touched. Is there anything more than all of this?</l>

	<l>Of course! Of course there's no one here. Nova could not have expected Palisade to be standing here, waiting with open arms, could she? The plan must be unfolded, the gears must turn. When the abstract pieces finally fall into place, the image will be revealed.</l>

Even though today I am Confused, the Blue C reminds me of where this all began. Palisade serves <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]>, so <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> will protect Palisade.</l>
	<l>Nova: Today... Yellow and A. Yellow, like a yolk. A to represent 'beginning'. Truly an auspicious roll. Something is growing, beginning. Perhaps Palisade's body was broken. But now she may be reborn here, in her haven. C Psalmist taught that everything in New Theland has always existed. Not in the same form across time (I was born after all!), but some "Nova essence" must have always existed... just as Palisade still exists in my heart. This is how I know she will return.</l>
	<l>Nova: Today... Red and D. An ominous sign. Anger... Blood... Death... Destruction... Dust. I'm beginning to realize why so many days have passed without any sign of Palisade--no word of assurance to guide my path. It was a wretched accident that Handfruit Haven was eaten by that mangy Dust Creature! It was a mistake that I ever met these "<![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dustbound<![CDATA[</color>]]>".

	<l pic="CV">Nova! How have you been enjoying the enhanced experience of the Metaclean Framework? I see you're progressing well through the newly unlocked Desert region! Now then, I think it's time we talked about our endgame.</l>
	<l pic="CP">Please, allow me, Visionary. I believe I'm the one to broach this subject with the appropriate dignity.</l>
	<l pic="CP">Nano Cleaner Nova, already in your brief existence you have traversed the breadth of New Theland's habitable regions and beyond. Soon your path will take you to still further reaches of this strange and beautiful world. What a gift it is to explore this world... what a wonder to inhabit it!</l>
	<l pic="CP">And yet... the fundamental problem of New Theland... it must be clear to you by now...</l>
	<l pic="CP"><![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]>. Decay. The inexorable creep of corruption and depravity that leads, always, to pain. We are created by <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]>, we should exist as glorious works of art!! And yet... we are made of <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> and from our first breath we begin to crumble back. We lose our innocence and turn to vile and selfish habits.</l>
	<l pic="CP">Lust!! Gluttony!! Anger!! Our every vulgar thought a stain upon the creative integrity of <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]>'s vision!!</l>
	<l pic="CP">And yet... there is still hope!! When the Graduated Prism is fully upgraded and the final shipment of <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> is sent, your purpose will be fulfilled: <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Anodyne<![CDATA[</color>]]>.</l>
	<l pic="CV">For once I must admit: that was beautifully spoken, Psalmist. You see, Nova, <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Anodyne<![CDATA[</color>]]> is the pivotal moment at which <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]> and New Theland fully reunite. It is a singularity at which <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]>'s network of influence expands into a fully self-sustaining regeneration of <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]>'s creative intent!</l>
	<l pic="CP">Do you see what this means, Nova?</l>
	<l pic="CP">Your continuous toil in fighting the rise of <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]>... </l>
	<l pic="CP">The ravenous hunger of our souls which reality cannot sate...</l>
	<l pic="CP">The promise of death and loss which haunt the brightest moments of our weary lives... </l>
	<l pic="CP">When <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Anodyne<![CDATA[</color>]]> is at hand, these nightmares will fade into the truest dreams of each inhabitant of New Theland. Can you taste it? Perfect communion... </l>
	<l pic="CV">And perfect efficiency... infinite energy formed via a transcendently wasteless system!</l>
	<l pic="CP">Everything has led you to this point, Nova. Go now, and bring about <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Anodyne<![CDATA[</color>]]>!</l>

And so we were reset. My friends forgot everything they had once known. Ash and I escaped by chance, with our Dust channeling peek-a-boo game.

	<l c="2">Elegy Beatty: Can't you see Nova? We did feel right! This is a sad and scary world, but we were building something better from the wreckage.</l>

	<l>FATUM NOVAE: ARMOR OF DESTINY\nPRESS ANY BUTTON TO START</l>
	<l>1. Once, there was a mighty king named Erythros who ruled New Theeland with wisdom and strength. Beneath his steady hand the kingdom prospered, and he was loved by all.</l>
	<l>2. One day, the fearsome dragon Lord Dustdra awoke from his ancient slumber. From the mouth of his cavern, he surveyed the kingdom and grew jealous of its happiness and wealth.</l>
	<l>3. Lord Dustdra flew to the castle and lay seige to it. Many brave knights set out to slay Lord Dustdra, but all of them perished. Grieved by the suffering of his people, King Erythros donned the Armor of Destiny and set out to face the dragon.</l>
	<l>4. King Erythros swung the Sword of Purity at Lord Dustdra. The magical blade struck true and cleaved the dragon's nigh-impermeable scales.</l>
	<l>5. Blow after blow King Erythros lay upon the dragon. But Lord Dustdra was cunning. He aimed for the Armor of Destiny with his massive claws, swiping away the breastplate, boots, and shield.</l>
	<l>6. With Erythros thus disarmed, Lord Dustdra at last slew the king with a final burst of flame. Weakened but victorious, Lord Dustdra flew back to his cavern, clutching the Armor of Destiny.</l>
	<l>7. After the battle, Prince Leuko, the heir to the throne, fell under a mysterious curse and turned to stone.</l>
	<l>8. With no king to guide them, the kingdom fell into darkness, awaiting the day foretold when the Prince Leuko, the White Bloodcell, would return to bring peace and prosperity back to New Theeland...</l>

	<l>Arteri: Mayhap the Armor of Destiny, once reunited in full, will have the power to lift the curse upon Prince Leuko that he might defeat Lord Dustdra once and for all and restore peace to New Theeland!</l>

	<l pic="ST">For many years, I lived alone here in the Desert. Yes, hm. When the sun was at its peak, I would sleep in the shadows of a stony shelf. In the dimming hours, I would travel the dunes, cataloguing the qualities of foliage and rock across the sands of outer New Theland.</l>
	<l pic="ST">Some people assume that the desert is defined by undifferentiated monotony... "just sand", so to speak. --Not so! The life patterns of the beasts and shrubberies, the fluctuations in wind and moisture, even the microscopic workings of the <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Nano Dust<![CDATA[</color>]]> are writ upon these sands like an illuminated manuscript!</l>
	<l pic="ST">Ah, but my quiet life of observation was turned on its head when Gravis fell from the stars. I found them, grasping at life, cradled in the deep, hemispherical crater of their impact. My days took on a stunning immediacy as I cared for this beautiful and fascinating soul. They lit a spark within me... made me feel fluid, shifting, alive.</l>

You have never heard of Import? Ah well... perhaps you have amnesia? That would make for quite an engaging tale, as it would unify your perspective with that of the player's, allowing for emotional revelations about your past that shake you to your core!!!</l>
	<l pic="NI">I myself, have suffered from a bit of amnesia! Or, perhaps not, it is hard to say... all I know is that one day, I awoke on the shores of this beach, salt-soaked and bedraggled. Was that the beginning of my life?</l>
	<l pic="NI">I have always been subject to sudden bouts of fainting, during which I would experience the most peculiar dreams. I heard a voice commanding me: "Do not create The Boht! The Boht is forbidden! The Boht shall be our downfall!"</l>

</d>
<d name="boat-guy-2">
<lines>
	<l pic="NI">I became obsessed! "What is The Boht?" I would wonder. I began to carry a journal with me so that I could record my speculations, and I pressed the voice for further information.</l>
	<l>[FADE]</l>
	<l>"Venerated dream voice," I said. "If it would please you, explain to me the qualities of The Boht, lest I create it accidentally, out of ignorance."</l>
	<l>"Ah... fair point," replied the voice. "This, you must never create: an oblong vessel, curved along the bottom, of size and strength enough to carry passengers upon its top surface. Thank you for your vigilance against The Boht."</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>And so, my days would pass. Slowly, I pieced together a finer and finer understanding of The Boht from the admonitions of the voice:</l>
	<l>"...Certainly, make no such shape as has a wide surface area with hollow interior!"</l>
	<l>"...Beware of hanging a large cloth from any tall poles which may rise from the center of your object!"</l>
	<l>"...Seek not to bring the front side of your creation to tapered point, lest it cut through its surrounding medium with great efficiency!"</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>I began to create many different models of The Boht, which now form the infrastructure of the town of Import! And yet... as proud as I am of all of my work, I still feel a bit hollow. Why was the dream voice so concerned about these mundane--if beautiful--structures? What is the true meaning of The Boht?</l>

	<l>Qatest Oob: You don't even have all the Metacoins, I bet! HA! Know how many are hidden around the world? DOUBT IT!! Good luck ever finding them all!! </l>
	<l>Qatest Oob: You're not REALLY gonna look for all the Metacoins, are you? Don't. There's no 'special secret item!' You should only look for them for the thrill of it.</l>
	<l>Qatest Oob: Yes, yes. Once you've been poisoned by 'incentive,' the pure joy of exploration... evaporates. Vanishes. Like a PIGEON IN THE KIRI!! (Kiri is Japanese for fog.) </l>
	<l>Qatest Oob: So what I'm SAYING is don't go find them all and cry on the forums when there's no reward!! THIS IS YOUR WARNING!! DON'T GO WASTING TIME FINDING THEM ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING!!</l>

	<l>Nova got the Metacoin Detector Pro.</l>
	<l>Qatest Oob: You can use it in Walkscale. Don't worry, it's the PRO version! Unfortunately it doesn't locate Metacoins exactly. But at least there are no ads!!</l>
	<l>Qatest Oob: You have {COINS} Metacoins. That's not all of them!! Come back when you almost have them all!! I will give you one more hint. There are no Metacoins in Center Sanctuary or the mountain in Outer Sands South! The only Metacoins found in Nanoscale are in chests!</l>
	<l>Qatest Oob: Also, THERE ARE MISSABLE METACOINS IN CHESTS!! AHAHAHA! But my strategy guide says "If you have opened every treasure chest you've seen, you won't miss them." </l>
	<l>Qatest Oob: INCREDIBLE. {COINS} METACOINS!! You've found nearly all of them! I knew this day would come.

	<l pic="KT">Oh hi. I'm Maryshaw Keytawny. I'm far more reasonable than that muffinhead doing the Metainfo narrations back in New Theland. I'm the historian here, keeping track of the creation of New Theland. Umm... so... welcome to... one of the Unzones? Sure, let's go with that term... I've got an eternity living in these Unzones, better make the most of it, right? Sigh...</l>
	<l pic="KT">Well, you can use the menu to return to New Theland. Uh... mystery person "S" wanted me to tell you that none of the Unzones are 'canon' and there's nothing to 'find'. I wish I could 'find' love... ah, there I go again...</l>
	<l pic="KT">Right. An Unzone is a place transcending New Theland. It was not deemed worthy by the two mystery persons, "M" and "S". Er... that is... there are two creation myths, one which says "<![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]>" created New Theland, which is 'canon', and the other, where M and S did it, which is 'meta'.</l>
	<l pic="KT">This is an architectural sketch by S. It was one of the inspirations for M's carwash in Blue Vale. The white field around you was used during the creation of Ridescale... I hear it was a drag to make. There's nothing out there, but you can head to the Green Area to see more. That picture of a face is... from when S was under a curse... we'll just ignore it... but it was used during the creation of very 'advanced' water tech.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Once, New Theland was planned to have all manners of temples and dungeons. This is an exterior that S made. Such plans were too expensive, so dungeons were dropped entirely. If you turn around, that structure was meant to be a strange home. Turn a little to the left, and the elevated structure in the distance is a prototype of Geof's Village.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Another area S made. Perhaps someone lived at the top... but, these types of places proved too expensive to make if only one Nanopoint would be in it. Alas, it was doomed to this Unzone. S quite likes the coziness and sense of climbing you get from it.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Actually this whole area you can see from this vista was an early prototype of the Blue Vale that S made to get the right sense of scale.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Mystery Pole--\nMystery Pole!--It's a mystery, and it's a pole!\n...\nLike my new song?\nThis pole actually doesn't do anything... I just thought a song might make things more fun.</l>
	<l pic="KT">We... don't know the origin of this. Nova went through a few iterations, so at some point there was an old version M left around, and the old copies' structure got all messed up. S says "This is the true incarnation of THE CENTER!". S is lying.</l>
	<l pic="KT">These little orcas are one of the first people that M created. Personally I think they're very cute. We ought to make dolls. I would buy one!! ... Not on this paycheck, though, sigh. Enjoy the cute!</l>
	<l pic="KT">Most of this Unzone is when M was crafting the initial visual style of New Theland. You'll find various visual tests and models that never made it into New Theland. I love the egg bushes and red grass...</l>
	<l pic="KT">These two structures are one of S's early architecture tests in making small, sort of fun structures to explore. They turned into that draft version M made over there. The orcas in M's version are to test the scale of the structure. </l>
	<l pic="KT">Welcome to THE CORNER! Ha ha ha, get it? It's like "<![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>The Center<![CDATA[</color>]]>", but... er. I like to come here some times and stare into the distance.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Welcome to S's earliest prototype of Cenote - a cylindrical cave in which sectors of the city are split up into height levels. S still really likes it and thinks it might have been faster to make, but it does feel far smaller than the final Cenote. This area is the 'governmental area', which has the elevator and entrance to Center Sanctuary.</l>
	<l pic="KT">This area was supposed to be a little garden or restaurant plaza. I've seen the sketches, and they are cute. Perhaps I could have enjoyed pizza in New Theland!</l>
	<l pic="KT">Before the outer road in Cenote, there was this lowered road that wrapped around the city. You could use this to access the sectors of the city! There were residential areas and the like planned.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Whenever I feel sad, I come here to feel empty. Augh, that was dark... um... this is the 2nd version of Cenote. S made this based on M's concept art. There isn't much here but you can feel the general structure. I am fond of the central roundabout thing that was going to lead to Center Sanctuary.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Apparently M and S had trouble figuring out how to make the elevator work. Eventually they just decided to only make an elevator platform, and not even sweat the details of it going to Center Sanctuary. Easy!</l>
	<l pic="KT">You can't climb up here, but this was presumably a prototype for some kind of building climbing challenge!</l>
	<l pic="KT">Starting to look familiar, eh? I don't really know when or why M decided to move on to the final version, but this old version with the rough areas of Cenote is here for you to explore. As you can see, the central elevator and parks were still yet to be roughed out. There are pillar supports running from the ground to the ceiling, too, which were removed, and even various structures built over the road.</l>
	<l pic="KT">(By the way. There are no other Metainfo points here.)</l>
	<l>Maryshaw Keytawny: You made it!! To. The. Last. Unzone!!! Congrats! My life has meaning. Um... this area is a bit hard to explain. Uh... this is what S calls a "teleport" zone. When S needed to get somewhere in New Theland fast, S could use this room and step on an icon to warp there instantly. Very convenient, I hear. But, none of the warps have been enabled here, for your safety.</l>
	<l>Maryshaw Keytawny: I'm not going to bother explaining what goes where exactly, but maybe you can guess. The "3" stands for "3D"... there's one room for the Outer Sands, one for Blue Vale, one for CCC, one for <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dustbound<![CDATA[</color>]]>, and another for Zera and Albumen Shore.</l>
	<l>Maryshaw Keytawny: S needed to make sure the Nano Assassins grew in difficulty correctly, so S made these testing rooms. Uh... thanks for reading all my info! Hehe... I really appreciate it.</l>
	<l pic="KT">S tested platforming, cameras, and even going from 3D to 2D here! But none of the area transitions work. What a cozy and quiet area. It reminds me of book stacks in libraries.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Did you know everything in New Theland is made of "purple cubes?" Haha, not really. But those purple cubes are what uh... well, just go walk into one.</l>
	<l pic="KT">A lot of the structures here were S playing around with architecture and level style ideas. The far far place in the distance was a mockup for Blue Vale West, and even contains an art gallery by M at the top!</l>
	<l pic="KT">Here's the "grey box" version of the Albumen Shore that S made based on some M layout sketches. For later 3D areas, it turned out to be faster for M to make most of the 3D areas either by herself or with some concept sketches from S, rather than go from a mockup to a real version. Anyways, regarding the Albumen Shore, before this there was a white sand version, but it was lost. I heard S still has pictures, though.</l>
	<l pic="KT">This is an old version of Blue Vale West that S made. It used to have old terrain as well, but it was changed in place to be used in the real New Theland.</l>
	<l pic="KT">True fans, like yours truly, remember this!! Oops it didn't make it into the real New Theland, ha ha! This was basically an 'art test'. Very very early. Like. June 2018. What's June? What's 2018? Umm...</l>
	<l>Maryshaw Keytawny: M made this old version of the Yolk areas a while ago! Much different and more play-ground-y. You may also notice the old versions of Nova's 2D art to the right, as well as the fact the tiles here are made with 16 pixels vs. the 8 pixels most of the tiles use!</l>
	<l pic="KT">This area was only used in a "trailer" and not in the final game. It is old! But this was what the place Nova comes out of her egg was based on. The area changed a lot, but the idea of Nova emerging from an egg didn't really change.</l>
	<l>Maryshaw Keytawny: Welcome to Olddust Village! Haha, I made that name. This is an old version of <![CDATA[<color=#90f3c0>]]>Dustbound<![CDATA[</color>]]> Village.</l>
	<l pic="KT">Here's an old version of Blue Vale. You may recognize this from old promotional materials! Oh-ho.</l>
	<l pic="KT">This was the first prototype area that S made. Actually it used to have this gaudy orange ground texture. Behind you were some buildings used for testing out the scale of architecture. In the distance was a mountain, on top was another tiny house that said "Young's Mountain Vacation Home," or something. Also, S tested out this 'ball shooting gameplay' in 3D where you were able to fire spheres at targets... umm... never mind.</l>

	<l>Gl-gloop... w-who are you? You're not from The Land! It's not safe here! There's dust everywhere... gloop! A lot of the others followed Sage through that portal, but I haven't seen them since... I hope they're okay!! Sage seemed mad. A lot of the others went with Mitra, though! </l>
	<l>Buy! Buy buy buy buy buy buy... buy... wwhooo stole my vacuum?? Who stole it?? You! Thief!!! Return it at once!! I see its etchings, I know that vacuum!!!</l>
	<l>Unfortunately, this bag doesn't contain Metacoins.</l>
	<l>Nova hears a strange sound resembling a warp portal from inside the home. However, the door has been moved, so there is no way in.</l>
	<l>The rock reads: "Other residents of The Land. It's your friend Mitra here! You should get out while you still can before it's too late... Wares and I are leaving. Anyone who wants to come with should get my attention soon. We will leave through the rift I opened inside my home. We don't know when Sage might swap something important with that dangerous vacuum, so it's important to leave quickly."</l>
	<l>---</l>
	<l>---</l>
	<l>---</l>
	<l>This way to Sage's exit portal!</l>
	<l>The words on the sign are faded. It is unsurprising, as the path beyond is completely torn up and destroyed, with nothing but a dust-consumed dark void remaining.</l>
	<l>Nova checks the chest, but whatever was there is gone. </l>
	<l>Words are scratched into the rock. "Goodbye, Young. Goodbye, Briar. Again... you did adequately. But in the time since you've swam away, The Land has begun to decay. Perhaps you were the one keeping this world together. Does this mean we're not needed, that we're not important to you? Many other residents seem to not care, as if they can't see the problems. Only that Mitra notices, but I can't imagine we could ever cooperate. I am going to find a way out of The Land, Young. Beginning with that Swap tool you left behind..."</l>
	<l>The words on the rock are scratched out.</l>
	<l>The rock says "your friends love you!"</l>

	<l>Nova exits from a textureless tunnel. Behind her, debris floats in the air. The tunnel appears to have been excavated, somehow, from empty space.</l>
	<l>In this expanse, nothing you see will change Nova's life or story. She is merely your way to get around.</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>Suddenly, Producer Tani appears.</l>
	<l>"Sorry, but if I could break the fourth wall for a second..."</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>"What I mean is: Nova's canon story in Anodyne 2 does not involve her warping out of the Nexus and coming here. However, what you find here IS canon to the origin of Anodyne 2, and, well... you'll see!"</l>
	<l>[CLEAR]</l>
	<l>(Also... something new has appeared in the Metashop.)</l>
