CP: Nano Cleaner Nova! What is the meaning of this?
CV: I’m worried about this behavior, young lady. It’s highly risky, and we wouldn’t want you to get hurt.
N: You don’t care about me at all, do you? You just want to use me!
CV: Not at all, Nova. You are highly prized by The Center, and we’ve always striven to demonstrate your worth with the utmost professionalism! The Metaclean Framework was specifically designed with—
CP: —That’s enough, Visionary. I told you your soulless pandering would be our downfall!
CP: Nova, we have sincerely attempted to support and guide you in your work to the best of our abilities. But… that was not all you needed, was it? You needed… love... caring... the nourishment of the spiritual self! You are not merely a machine to be oiled and controlled.
CP: I understand that now, Nova… Don’t you see? I too, feel the emptiness inside… the longing. Nova, these feelings are important: they point us to The Center, to The Anodyne!
N: I hate the Glandilock Seed. I hate that it lives inside of me and wraps itself around my every experience. It hurts me when I want to explore. It numbs me when I want to feel. It makes me afraid when I want to be strong.
N: Why didn’t anyone warn me? How could you let this happen? I didn’t know what it would be like until it was far too late...
CP: Nova...
CP: I should think you’d understand this by now. The world outside is broken... filled with lascivious temptations and destructive thoughts. Nothing of true value comes from the Dust, no matter how alluring it might seem. The Center is saving you the trouble of mucking about in that cesspool of shame and heartache! It may seem like we are missing out now, but nothing out there can compare to the glory of The Anodyne!!
N: I just don’t think I believe that anymore... I want to be able to feel things and see things and find my own path...
CV: Nova, The Center has been very patient with your wandering heart. But now... that patience wears thin. What choice do you imagine that you have here? Do you think that you could be anything besides the Nano Cleaner?
N: ...

[FADEOFF]
CP: No. No! She’s been destroyed! Visionary, what have you done?? I poured my heart out to Nova, and you broke her will!!
CV: That Cleaner was poisoned from the start by your mindless chatter. Who was it that stoked her illogical desires?
CP: Oh Center, forgive us… how long can this go on?
CV: As long as it must, obviously. The Anodyne will work beautifully—it’s only a matter of time! With my guidance, the next Cleaner will succeed.
CP: But the creation of a Cleaner is costly! And... and if a new Palisade is generated as well, The Center’s energy stores will be left in critical condition!
CV: A new Palisade? Ha! Palisade’s guidance was worse than your own! The Center briefed me on the consequences of that little experiment.
CP: Palisade nurtured Nova’s soul. Perhaps if she were still around, Nova would not have turned to such drastic measures!
CV: Sentimental fool!! You’re beginning to sound like that wayward Nova! Have you forgotten what was wrought by the previous Cleaner, before the initiation of the Glandilock Protocol? Just trust in The Center... the iteration is nearly complete! All we need do is wait...

Nova watches as C Psalmist delivers those familiar words, this time to the new Cleaner... Zera. She steels herself to execute the next stage of her plan.

Hi there! You've reached the end of the story of Nova and New Theland. Marina and I are so glad you finished our game.
But... I heard the Metashop got a new shipment in. There was something suspicious in The Nexus, too. 
Hmm. I wonder what it could be!

When you reload your save file, you'll be back in Blue Vale Center, as if Nova never confronted The Center. You may wish to investigate these aforementioned new things. Hm hm hm...
Okay, farewell! Be safe!

RP: Being cleaned by Nova was the most wonderful feeling. All of the bitter rage that churned inside of me was put to rest. I was so happy to rise above my shameful old behaviors.

RP: But as the novelty wore off, I began to remember the source of my anger, the questions that once haunted me: why did The Center create New Theland? Why is the world so full of fear and pain... pain which we compound in endless cycles of exploitation? But the fire within me had gone quiet, and only faint embers remained.

Qatest Oob: I've been doing that FOR YEARS. In 2D *AND* 3D!!!
Qatest Oob: You don't even have all the Metacoins, I bet! HA! Know how many are hidden around the world? DOUBT IT!! Good luck ever finding them all!! 
Qatest Oob: You're not REALLY gonna look for all the Metacoins, are you? Don't. There's no 'special secret item!' You should only look for them for the thrill of it.
Qatest Oob: Yes, yes. Once you've been poisoned by 'incentive,' the pure joy of exploration... evaporates. Vanishes. Like a PIGEON IN THE KIRI!! (Kiri is Japanese for fog.) 
Qatest Oob: So what I'm SAYING is don't go find them all and cry on the forums when there's no reward!! THIS IS YOUR WARNING!! DON'T GO WASTING TIME FINDING THEM ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING!!

Qatest Oob: Hmph. So you've found {COINS} Metacoins! I bet you're excited. BUT HA! The more you find, the HARDER IT GETS TO FIND THE REST! Hope you've been making a spreadsheet! I bet you want a hint! "Oh, please, great Qatest Oob, give poor me a hint!" WELL TOO BAD! THERE ARE NO HINTS, MILLENNIAL! THIS IS THE REAL WORLD!!! GO FIND 400 AND COME BACK!!

Qatest Oob: IMPRESSIVE. You've found {COINS} Metacoins!! You look like you're gonna do your own ICO!! Fine... I will give you a hint. Here is a special item.
Nova got the Metacoin Detector Pro.
Qatest Oob: You can use it in Walkscale. Don't worry, it's the PRO version! Unfortunately it doesn't locate Metacoins exactly. But at least there are no ads!!

Qatest Oob: You have {COINS} Metacoins. That's not all of them!! Come back when you almost have them all!! I will give you one more hint. There are no Metacoins in Center Sanctuary or the mountain in Outer Sands South! The only Metacoins found in Nanoscale are in chests!
Qatest Oob: Also, THERE ARE MISSABLE METACOINS IN CHESTS!! AHAHAHA! But my strategy guide says "If you have opened every treasure chest you've seen, you won't miss them." 
// At ?? high amount
Qatest Oob: INCREDIBLE. {COINS} METACOINS!! You've found nearly all of them! I knew this day would come. Yes, Nova, I merely played the part of 'quirky NPC' so that I would encourage you... truly, you understand the 'hunt'. As stated... there is no reward. Not even if you actually found all of them.

Suddenly, a voice. It's Producer Tani! Does he have a reward? Was Oob wrong?
"No. Well done. Well, it's as Oob said. There is no reward. Farewell... vanish vanish..."

scene extra-area
// R1N - 0 to 6
KT: Oh hi. I'm Maryshaw Keytawny. I'm far more reasonable than that muffinhead doing the Metainfo narrations back in New Theland. I'm the historian here, keeping track of the creation of New Theland. Umm... so... welcome to... one of the Unzones? Sure, let's go with that term... I've got an eternity living in these Unzones, better make the most of it, right? Sigh...
KT: Well, you can use the menu to return to New Theland. Uh... mystery person "S" wanted me to tell you that none of the Unzones are 'canon' and there's nothing to 'find'. I wish I could 'find' love... ah, there I go again...
KT: Right. An Unzone is a place transcending New Theland. It was not deemed worthy by the two mystery persons, "M" and "S". Er... that is... there are two creation myths, one which says "The Center" created New Theland, which is 'canon', and the other, where M and S did it, which is 'meta'.
KT: This is an architectural sketch by S. It was one of the inspirations for M's carwash in Blue Vale. The white field around you was used during the creation of Ridescale... I hear it was a drag to make. There's nothing out there, but you can head to the Green Area to see more. That picture of a face is... from when S was under a curse... we'll just ignore it... but it was used during the creation of very 'advanced' water tech.
KT: Once, New Theland was planned to have all manners of temples and dungeons. This is an exterior that S made. Such plans were too expensive, so dungeons were dropped entirely. If you turn around, that structure was meant to be a strange home. Turn a little to the left, and the elevated structure in the distance is a prototype of Geof's Village.
KT: Another area S made. Perhaps someone lived at the top... but, these types of places proved too expensive to make if only one Nanopoint would be in it. Alas, it was doomed to this Unzone. S quite likes the coziness and sense of climbing you get from it.
KT: Actually this whole area you can see from this vista was an early prototype of the Blue Vale that S made to get the right sense of scale.

// ZZ_****Ring1Test 7 12
KT: Mystery Pole--\nMystery Pole!--It's a mystery, and it's a pole!\n...\nLike my new song?\nThis pole actually doesn't do anything... I just thought a song might make things more fun.
KT: We... don't know the origin of this. Nova went through a few iterations, so at some point there was an old version M left around, and the old copies' structure got all messed up. S says "This is the true incarnation of THE CENTER!". S is lying.
KT: These little orcas are one of the first people that M created. Personally I think they're very cute. We ought to make dolls. I would buy one!! ... Not on this paycheck, though, sigh. Enjoy the cute!
KT: Most of this Unzone is when M was crafting the initial visual style of New Theland. You'll find various visual tests and models that never made it into New Theland. I love the egg bushes and red grass...
KT: These two structures are one of S's early architecture tests in making small, sort of fun structures to explore. They turned into that draft version M made over there. The orcas in M's version are to test the scale of the structure. 
KT: Welcome to THE CORNER! Ha ha ha, get it? It's like "The Center", but... er. I like to come here some times and stare into the distance.

// ZZ_CCC_Old_1 13 15
KT: Welcome to S's earliest prototype of Cenote - a cylindrical cave in which sectors of the city are split up into height levels. S still really likes it and thinks it might have been faster to make, but it does feel far smaller than the final Cenote. This area is the 'governmental area', which has the elevator and entrance to Center Sanctuary.
KT: This area was supposed to be a little garden or restaurant plaza. I've seen the sketches, and they are cute. Perhaps I could have enjoyed pizza in New Theland!
KT: Before the outer road in Cenote, there was this lowered road that wrapped around the city. You could use this to access the sectors of the city! There were residential areas and the like planned.

// ZZ_CCC_OLD_2 16 18
KT: Whenever I feel sad, I come here to feel empty. Augh, that was dark... um... this is the 2nd version of Cenote. S made this based on M's concept art. There isn't much here but you can feel the general structure. I am fond of the central roundabout thing that was going to lead to Center Sanctuary.
KT: Apparently M and S had trouble figuring out how to make the elevator work. Eventually they just decided to only make an elevator platform, and not even sweat the details of it going to Center Sanctuary. Easy!
KT: You can't climb up here, but this was presumably a prototype for some kind of building climbing challenge!

// ZZ_CCC_OLD_3 19 20
KT: Starting to look familiar, eh? I don't really know when or why M decided to move on to the final version, but this old version with the rough areas of Cenote is here for you to explore. As you can see, the central elevator and parks were still yet to be roughed out. There are pillar supports running from the ground to the ceiling, too, which were removed, and even various structures built over the road.
KT: (By the way. There are no other Metainfo points here.)

// DEBUG2DFAKE 21 23
$KT$: You made it!! To. The. Last. Unzone!!! Congrats! My life has meaning. Um... this area is a bit hard to explain. Uh... this is what S calls a "teleport" zone. When S needed to get somewhere in New Theland fast, S could use this room and step on an icon to warp there instantly. Very convenient, I hear. But, none of the warps have been enabled here, for your safety.
$KT$: I'm not going to bother explaining what goes where exactly, but maybe you can guess. The "3" stands for "3D"... there's one room for the Outer Sands, one for Blue Vale, one for CCC, one for Dustbound, and another for Zera and Albumen Shore.
$KT$: S needed to make sure the Nano Assassins grew in difficulty correctly, so S made these testing rooms. Uh... thanks for reading all my info! Hehe... I really appreciate it.

// ZZ test3d 24
KT: S tested platforming, cameras, and even going from 3D to 2D here! But none of the area transitions work. What a cozy and quiet area. It reminds me of book stacks in libraries.

// 25 ZY_Sean Test Arches
KT: Did you know everything in New Theland is made of "purple cubes?" Haha, not really. But those purple cubes are what uh... well, just go walk into one.
KT: A lot of the structures here were S playing around with architecture and level style ideas. The far far place in the distance was a mockup for Blue Vale West, and even contains an art gallery by M at the top!
// 27 ZZ alb old
KT: Here's the "grey box" version of the Albumen Shore that S made based on some M layout sketches. For later 3D areas, it turned out to be faster for M to make most of the 3D areas either by herself or with some concept sketches from S, rather than go from a mockup to a real version. Anyways, regarding the Albumen Shore, before this there was a white sand version, but it was lost. I heard S still has pictures, though.
// 28 rin ggoem
KT: This is an old version of Blue Vale West that S made. It used to have old terrain as well, but it was changed in place to be used in the real New Theland.
// 29 jonifeartest
KT: True fans, like yours truly, remember this!! Oops it didn't make it into the real New Theland, ha ha! This was basically an 'art test'. Very very early. Like. June 2018. What's June? What's 2018? Umm...
// 30 gif nanoalb
$KT$: M made this old version of the Yolk areas a while ago! Much different and more play-ground-y. You may also notice the old versions of Nova's 2D art to the right, as well as the fact the tiles here are made with 16 pixels vs. the 8 pixels most of the tiles use!
// 31 chapel trailer
KT: This area was only used in a "trailer" and not in the final game. It is old! But this was what the place Nova comes out of her egg was based on. The area changed a lot, but the idea of Nova emerging from an egg didn't really change.
// 32 nano db old
$KT$: Welcome to Olddust Village! Haha, I made that name. This is an old version of Dustbound Village.
// 33
KT: Here's an old version of Blue Vale. You may recognize this from old promotional materials! Oh-ho.
// 34
KT: This was the first prototype area that S made. Actually it used to have this gaudy orange ground texture. Behind you were some buildings used for testing out the scale of architecture. In the distance was a mountain, on top was another tiny house that said "Young's Mountain Vacation Home," or something. Also, S tested out this 'ball shooting gameplay' in 3D where you were able to fire spheres at targets... umm... never mind.

scene pg-land
Gl-gloop... w-who are you? You're not from The Land! It's not safe here! There's dust everywhere... gloop! A lot of the others followed Sage through that portal, but I haven't seen them since... I hope they're okay!! Sage seemed mad. A lot of the others went with Mitra, though! 
Buy! Buy buy buy buy buy buy... buy... wwhooo stole my vacuum?? Who stole it?? You! Thief!!! Return it at once!! I see its etchings, I know that vacuum!!!
Unfortunately, this bag doesn't contain Metacoins.
Nova hears a strange sound resembling a warp portal from inside the home. However, the door has been moved, so there is no way in.
The rock reads: "Other residents of The Land. It's your friend Mitra here! You should get out while you still can before it's too late... Wares and I are leaving. Anyone who wants to come with should get my attention soon. We will leave through the rift I opened inside my home. We don't know when Sage might swap something important with that dangerous vacuum, so it's important to leave quickly."
---
---
---
This way to Sage's exit portal!
The words on the sign are faded. It is unsurprising, as the path beyond is completely torn up and destroyed, with nothing but a dust-consumed dark void remaining.

Nova checks the chest, but whatever was there is gone. 
Words are scratched into the rock. "Goodbye, Young. Goodbye, Briar. Again... you did adequately. But in the time since you've swam away, The Land has begun to decay. Perhaps you were the one keeping this world together. Does this mean we're not needed, that we're not important to you? Many other residents seem to not care, as if they can't see the problems. Only that Mitra notices, but I can't imagine we could ever cooperate. I am going to find a way out of The Land, Young. Beginning with that Swap tool you left behind..."
The words on the rock are scratched out.
The rock says "your friends love you!"
