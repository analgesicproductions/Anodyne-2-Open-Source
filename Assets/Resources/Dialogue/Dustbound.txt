Nova’s body aches from the venomous barbs of the angry swarm. She begins to breathe a sigh of relief as they buzz away--until she realizes why they have fled: Dust! A thick cloud of it surrounds her, irritating her lungs and setting her teeth on edge. 
[CLEAR]
Slowly, Nova begins to squint her eyes open amidst the haze. Her vision is blurry at first, but she can make out a group of figures looming over her. What sort of creatures would walk through the Dust unafraid?

[FADE]
Suddenly, an image of Palisade flashes across Nova’s mind...
“Nova, I’d like you to have my Card now! Keep it close, and don’t use it to reinforce the Prism. May it protect you from all harm, even when I am far away...”
[CLEAR]
Frantically, Nova plunges her hand into her inventory hole and feels around for Palisade’s Card. The dark figures begin to reach out towards her! No! Her fingers finally close around the Card and she whips it out in front of her! The Card’s holographic surface glints in the light. The illustration of Palisade, the Guardian, faces the groping mob!!

Nova stirs, and opens her eyes. Seated next to her... is that the monster who destroyed the Palisade Card?? Nova wants to cry out, but she is too weak, too disoriented.
[FADEOFF]
__c1 Dust Monster: Ah... waking up, you little Porridge Pot? How are you feeling?
[FADE]
The monster is talking to her again... what does it want from her? Is it some sort of emissary from the Dust? Perhaps an assassin, meant to “take care” of her... meant to turn the tide in the Dust's war against The Center...
[FADEOFF]
__c1 Assassin Monster?: Listen... I think we may have got off on the wrong foot. I was just trying to lend a hand back there, and things got a little dicey.
[FADE]
The creature stares at Nova quizzically as if it is expecting something from her. Perhaps it is in need of Nano Cleaning? But... is that even possible? Nova is already at Nanoscale... Is there some way to--
[FADEOFF]
__c1 Monster In Need Of Cleaning??: Hey, uh... can you stop making the room go all dark like that? I’m like trying to have a conversation here? Can you just talk to me?

scene db-burial-1
[FADE]
As Nova approaches the clearing, she sees a gathering of the Dustbound standing around a strange lump, wrapped in cloth. With a start, she realizes that this was once one of them. The body of a Dustbound, unmoving and silent. Dead.
Suddenly, they begin to wave their arms in a strange sort of dance.

Nova looks around. A tall dustbound with elegant and sharp features steps forward. She begins to speak in a strangely rhythmic voice. When she says the words "You go on ahead", all the Dustbound say the same, in unison.
[CLEAR]
Tall and Elegant Woman:
You go on ahead -
(You go on ahead!)
The emptiness of the cardinal redirection, the slightness of your hand as it gently droops. A magic trick born out of the simple act of fading light. Of shadows and a planet turning, a universe folding in upon itself, as I entered your room and you lay beneath a thin blanket
[CLEAR]
You go on ahead -
(You go on ahead!)
How richly you played upon the oils and spices, the pedals and the pipes. I would resurface into cordiality for you, I would dance upon the seams of scent and catalogue your fingers. Coronate me, cardomom and pepper pods and all the wafting whimpers of your wings
[CLEAR]
You go on ahead -
(You go on ahead!)
Elemental traces, copy-pasted, crucializing carbon dates and grocery lists and all the times that you stayed late. I pat my hand and where you left me is a bell of soft and porous foam, a row of gills you left for me to breathe. Spores twinkle down like salt and rain and we thank you for your courage as...
[CLEAR]
You go on ahead!
(You go on ahead!)

scene haven-first-time
[FADE]
The cavernous room is beautiful but deathly still. The soft creak of the doors disrupts the quiet. There's no one here.

Of course! Of course there's no one here. Nova could not have expected Palisade to be standing here, waiting with open arms, could she? The plan must be unfolded, the gears must turn. When the abstract pieces finally fall into place, the image will be revealed.
[FADE]
There is an altar at the center of the room. It is a clue, perhaps a portal through which Palisade may be summoned! Its structure is, of course, a key to its use. A natural trait of intelligent design...

Rite I, the dice. One must take note of the color and letter on which the dice land. Life is never truly random, it only might appear that way to the limitations of one's mind.
[SMOOTHCAM TO bridgeVC in 1.8]
Rite II, the bridge. It is a walkway made of unstable materials. The edges of the bridge must never be touched, as indicated by their bright yellow colouration.
[SMOOTHCAM TO slideVC in 1.8]
Rite III, the gift. One is to pour out an offering and watch it fall away. To be truly free one must let go of the things that provide false comfort, false safety. The Center will unfold and that is enough.
[SMOOTHCAM TO matcherVC in 1.8]
[FADE]
It all becomes clear to Nova: she need only carry out the rites faithfully for Palisade to surely return! But before she can begin, Nova nearly collapses onto the ground. It's as though she's broken somehow, she can feel the Glandilock Seed coughing and sputtering. 
[CLEAR]
She remembers the bed that she woke up on earlier that day with a strange sense of longing. It’s as though merely existing across time has become a sickness to her... could unconsciousness be its remedy?
She heads home. She will perform the rites soon... just... after...

__c1 $DK$: Doing what?
$N$: Calling me those nonsense words!
__c1 $DK$: Nonsense words? You mean like "Casserole" and "Split Pea"? Those aren't nonsense words, they're delectable food items!
$N$: “F-food items”?
__c1 $DK$: Ohhhhhh... okay. I think I get it now. You don't know about eating, do you? Well. Remember yesterday, how we learned about talking? Well... eating food... it's kinda like “reverse talking”... instead of THOUGHTS coming OUT of your mouth... you have FOOD going INTO your mouth!
$N$: ...huh?
__c1 $DK$: Wow, you're lucky I'm here to explain this so clearly! I bet you need to eat, since apparently you've never done it. AHeheh!! Here, try this. It's "cream of mushroom soup". Did you know that it's "great for baking"?

$N$: Palisade. I have taken care of my bodily needs.
$N$: Now, I will perform the rites which you have laid out for me.
endscene

scene haven-dice
$N$: Ahh... here we have Blue and C. Blue is the color of water and of Palisade's dress. Center Sanctuary lies beneath the water in CCC. It was there that I met Palisade of the Blue Dress. Even though today I am Confused, the Blue C reminds me of where this all began. Palisade serves The Center, so The Center will protect Palisade.
$N$: Today... Yellow and A. Yellow, like a yolk. A to represent 'beginning'. Truly an auspicious roll. Something is growing, beginning. Perhaps Palisade's body was broken. But now she may be reborn here, in her haven. C Psalmist taught that everything in New Theland has always existed. Not in the same form across time (I was born after all!), but some “Nova essence” must have always existed... just as Palisade still exists in my heart. This is how I know she will return.
$N$: Today... Red and D. An ominous sign. Anger... Blood... Death... Destruction... Dust. I'm beginning to realize why so many days have passed without any sign of Palisade--no word of assurance to guide my path. It was a wretched accident that Handfruit Haven was eaten by that mangy Dust Creature! It was a mistake that I ever met these "Dustbound". It felt so good to not be alone that I've allowed myself to become split in my purpose. I have lusted over foolish fantasies of a life that could never be my own.

$N$: Incorrect... what a disappointment you are.
endscene

//<As you pour out soup>
$N$: Today, I learned how to eat. The soup felt warm and tingly as it went down my throat. As I pour out this bowl, I remember that such pleasures are fleeting. Soon I will reconnect with Palisade and with The Center, and there will no longer be any need for wasteful activities like "eating" and "sleeping". Soon everything will be in its proper place once again...
$N$: *Yawn*
$N$: Soon.....
[FADEFULL]
Days pass. Nova continues in her routine, helping Elegy Beatty with the farming during the day and fulfilling the Palisade Rites in the evening. It is strange to have a space to call her own, strange to have a set of familiar faces greeting her day after day.
None of it matters, of course. Palisade will be returning any day now. But before she does, Drem Kinako approaches Nova with a proposal...

$N$: What I “enjoy” has nothing to do with what is right.
__c1 $DK$: Okay, well. Whatever your reasons are... I'm glad you're here. 
__c1 $DK$: Umm... we'll fight to a deadlock, then team up against a surprise challenger, ok?
$N$: Understood.

The Center: Who are YOU to turn against my will? I CREATED you!
__c1 $DK$: Maybe you did. If you created me, then you should really understand by now: I am my own being! I am compelled by my heart and my mind!! You have forfeit your right to me, to all of us, by our very nature. We exist, we are beautiful, and you have NO claim to us!!

[FADENOFADE]
Nova’s blood runs cold. She hears the soft squelch of the writhing Gwoms, feels the hot breath off Gustine Papellum’s probing tongue. The Dustbound weren’t there to see Misteria Waizel wasting away alone in a dim, disheveled room! They hadn’t borne the brunt of Bran Maligden’s endless, bitter rage! 
[CLEAR]
Blinded by arrogance, they could never understand the true nature of the Dust! C Psalmist had warned Nova about such folly! She had been warned!! Now the Dustbound would burn, and Nova with them. Who can sidestep fate? There is no way forward but The Center’s. Stupid, disgusting, foolish... what could she have been thinking???

__c1 $DK$: Crumb Coat, wait, I'm sorry! I didn't know that was going to happen... I know you must have been uncomfortable. Next time we'll go over everything beforehand!
$N$: Next time? There's not going to be a next time!! I don't belong here, Drem, isn't that obvious by now? And stop calling me those ridiculous food names.
__c1 $DK$: I'm sorry. Nova, I'm sorry. You don't have to wrestle anymore... But that doesn't mean you don't belong here.
$N$: I came here because it was my duty. I came here for Palisade! I don't know why I let you all rope me into these ridiculous games! Maybe I thought I could help you somehow. Maybe I thought I could show you the importance of fighting the Dust.
__c2 $EB$: Okay, hold on... be real, Nova. You "let us" take you in because you wanted us to! Nobody forced you to accept our friendship!
$N$: Fine. You're right. It was my own mistake. I know that now. I've failed. Palisade is NEVER coming back, and I have only myself to blame. I can't control myself enough to stay here, I can't be trusted. I need to leave here and continue my mission alone.
__c1 $DK$: You know...
__c1 $DK$: You know, you're being a real $Dusting jerk! To me, to Elegy, but also to yourself!!
$N$: ...
$N$: I'm sorry you feel that way, Drem. I'm sorry that you've been blinded to the evil that swirls around this entire village. 
$N$: It is crystal clear to me now. You may think you are just playing around, but messing with the Dust will always lead to tragedy in the end. I've seen the effects of the Dust first-hand. I know where this leads.
$N$: And I wouldn't be your friend if I didn't try to warn you.
__c2 $EB$: If that's really how you feel... then maybe you do need to leave.
$N$: O-Of course it's how I feel! I am the Nano Cleaner. I am the representative of The Center to all of New Theland. And it's long past time for me to stop moping around, and to start acting the part.
__c1 $DK$: ...
__c1 $DK$: After everything we've been through... I can't listen to any more of this.

"No Ash, No!! Put that down, NOW!" Nova says sternly.
"Heehehee! Aunty Nova play!!" Ash squeals, kicking and tripping over the sacred dice. 
"Stop it! You don't know what that's for!" Nova grunts as she moves toward the child.

Ash Beatty giggles and runs away. "Chase me! Chase me!!" she screams. She rushes across the ritual bridge, pausing to bounce up and down wildly in the center.
"Come back here!! Bad Ash! You're being very naughty!" Nova cries.

Ash's smile fades as she realizes Nova is truly angry. 
"Me... n-no naughty!!" Ash cries.
She slips down the offering chute, and runs away...

Shame and anger flood through Nova, far beyond any measure of control. She bares her powers like a violent hurricane upon Handfruit Haven. The ritual elements are torn apart and hurled at the exquisitely carved walls. When she is finished, nothing but rubble remains...

Nova peers down the edge of the spire. Below, the dust storm quietly rages, unchanged.
She tries to reflect on the past weeks, but it's all clouded by waves of anger. She feels an uncomfortable tickle in her throat, a strange heaviness in her legs... but ignores it.
How could the Dustbound live like that? How could Palisade be gone? Before she can formulate an answer, the same questions loop in her head, drowning out her thoughts.
[CLEAR]
What was going on? Perhaps The Center had the answers, but for now, Nova drags her weary body all the way back to Center Sanctuary...

LaShawn Mixte: Ah. Hm. I am a Dust painter. Yes. I mix the Dust with a binding agent, and paint pictures of people and plants. Indeed.
LaShawn Mixte: Dust paintings... Hm. Inevitably they decay into nothing. Thus, they are of limited use to the collector. My pre-Dustbound work still circulates in the art market, fetching ever higher and higher prices. It is startlingly easy for well-intentioned art to be recontextualized by power and industry until little of its original value remains.
LaShawn Mixte: What is a great artist? Ah. Hm. Simply a person.

Re Grubbins: Here's a fun snack idea for the kids: try pressing some dark soil into the shape of chocolate cookies. Next, find a patch of white fungus for the "creme filling". Get it? You can pretend to be eating a chocolate sandwich cookie (haha... ewww! gross!!) but it will still taste delicious!
Mi Grubbins: Ah... we traveled so long searching for the finest dirt. Truly it is here. What depth of flavor has the Dustbound Dust! A subtle citrus tang offsetting its rich, umami flavor.
Fa Grubbins: Hm. I actually don't like the taste of dirt. That's okay though. There are many different foods to eat, and my friends love me just the same!
