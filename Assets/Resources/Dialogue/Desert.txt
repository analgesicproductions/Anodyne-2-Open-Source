CP: Ah... awake at last. Thank The Center! What happened?? When I found you outside, hobbling back towards Cenote, body ravaged by Dust... I didn’t know what to think. Ah! Never mind. All is forgiven! I’m just glad you are back, and that The Center was able to heal your wounds. And you’ll be pleased to hear that the Cards and Dust you were carrying allowed The Center to clear the remaining Dust storms. You may now freely explore the entirety of New Theland!!

CP: You know... um... it was painful to me when Palisade disappeared and then you did as well. I must admit... at first I thought that you had run off together on some secret mission that you had concocted without me... 
CP: But... no... she is truly gone, isn't she? Nova... I don't blame you for hiding away for a while. But now that you are back... you won't go disappearing on me again, will you? We have to look out for each other now, Nova... my Nova...
CP: You have seen and experienced many difficult things, Nova, but look at how strong you are, how purposeful. You don't understand what a blessing you have been given.

You are made of bloody baggage, it weighs you down.
Gravity pulling your parcels to the dirt and yet—

You are an organization, a contraption of contractions
And so it is you rise instead of falling,
And so it is you stand to meet your fate.

//<lighting switch and C Visionary rises up from a cloud of fog>
???:n —Alright, alright, Psalmist, I believe you’ve had your say. Nova, please allow me to introduce myself. I am C Visionary.
CV: Let’s be real, Nova: New Theland is changing. Every day you see and experience new things that fundamentally alter how you relate to the world. Believe it or not, The Center welcomes this shift!
CV: I was brought on because The Center understands the necessity of a strategic realignment. It’s no longer enough to follow the old moralizing about what we “must” or “mustn’t” do. Let’s reinvent cleaning so it strikes at the heart of the problems facing the New Theland of today.
//3 4
CP: Hmph… C Visionary is misguided at best, Nano Cleaner Nova. In the face of fear and chaos, *integrity*—not innovation—should light our path. If we are merely blown about by the winds of change, inevitably we will lose our way.
CV: Typically rigid thinking from the old guard. Nova, a strong wind will shatter an inflexible structure. But if we harness the aerodynamics of the mind, we can transform our baser needs and desires into something more powerful, more transcendent. And indeed, what could be a greater tribute to the sacred things, to the greatness of The Center?
// 5 9
CV: Today I am pleased to present the Metaclean Framework. The Metaclean Framework is a holistic user experience overhaul, which will help you progress toward the fulfillment of your ultimate goal…
CV: As you go about cleaning, you can now find Metacoins, a special currency which may be used to access the deepest secrets of New Theland! Spend your Metacoins in the Menu to purchase behind-the-scenes info and items from The Center’s personal collection. Engaging with the exciting new Metaclean Framework is sure to enhance your investment in the world of New Theland!
CV: We also would like to present you with the Metaclean Manual, an item which you can read to find out all the ins and outs of your new Framework.
[FADE]
Acquired item: Metaclean Manual.

CV: Ah, Nova. Has your user experience with the Metaclean Framework been satisfying?

Walk with excitement, Nova! Bring forth change!
CP: Er, yes. Now, don't forget about the newly opened regions of New Theland, Nova. The denizens of New Theland are counting on you!

CV: Nova, the Anodyne's date is approaching fast. The revolution is at hand, and you are its leader!

scene desert-sanc-2-1
CV: Nova! How have you been enjoying the enhanced experience of the Metaclean Framework? I see you’re progressing well through the newly unlocked Desert region! Now then, I think it’s time we talked about our endgame.
CP: Please, allow me, Visionary. I believe I’m the one to broach this subject with the appropriate dignity.
CP: Nano Cleaner Nova, already in your brief existence you have traversed the breadth of New Theland’s habitable regions and beyond. Soon your path will take you to still further reaches of this strange and beautiful world. What a gift it is to explore this world… what a wonder to inhabit it!
CP: And yet… the fundamental problem of New Theland… it must be clear to you by now...
CP: Dust. Decay. The inexorable creep of corruption and depravity that leads, always, to pain. We are created by The Center, we should exist as glorious works of art!! And yet… we are made of Dust and from our first breath we begin to crumble back. We lose our innocence and turn to vile and selfish habits.
CP: Lust!! Gluttony!! Anger!! Our every vulgar thought a stain upon the creative integrity of The Center’s vision!!
CP: And yet… there is still hope!! When the Graduated Prism is fully upgraded and the final shipment of Dust is sent, your purpose will be fulfilled: The Anodyne.
CV: For once I must admit: that was beautifully spoken, Psalmist. You see, Nova, The Anodyne is the pivotal moment at which The Center and New Theland fully reunite. It is a singularity at which The Center’s network of influence expands into a fully self-sustaining regeneration of The Center’s creative intent!
CP: Do you see what this means, Nova?
CP: Your continuous toil in fighting the rise of Dust… 
CP: The ravenous hunger of our souls which reality cannot sate…
CP: The promise of death and loss which haunt the brightest moments of our weary lives… 
CP: When The Anodyne is at hand, these nightmares will fade into the truest dreams of each inhabitant of New Theland. Can you taste it? Perfect communion… 
CV: And perfect efficiency… infinite energy formed via a transcendently wasteless system!
CP: Everything has led you to this point, Nova. Go now, and bring about The Anodyne!

WW: Errr... I’m sorry. Oh... how embarrassing... I’m having a hard time opening myself to resonance. Oh goodness. I promise I would like to let you in, but my body can be so frustrating at times.
WW: Esteemed Nano Cleaner. I would hate to have you go out of your way for me... but I have heard of a powerful artifact called the Trylock Collar. Perhaps... if you were to collect the Collar and fasten it around my neck... I would be able to resonate with you once again. Oh, I would be so pleased, Nano Cleaner Nova, if I could belong to you.

__c2 $EB$: The life we had here in Dustbound Village was incompatible with The Center’s vision. And so we were reset. My friends forgot everything they had once known.

Nova’s head swims... her vision fades into a dark and endless tunnel. Ah yes... She is starting to remember why she left The Dustbound. Drem... Elegy... all they ever wanted was to make a fool of Nova... to trample on the sacred task she had received from Palisade!
[CLEAR]
Long ago--before Nova had even glimpsed the open sky--she had known the malice that lurked inside her own heart. Bran Maligden had taught her that! And what had Nova been hoping to gain by visiting Elegy again? She was no better than Gustine Papellum, always giving in to her basest desires for comfort and pleasure!
[CLEAR]
“It isn’t worth it!”, Nova wants to scream at herself. She feels torn apart, but most of all she is afraid. How can she possibly hold out forever? The Dust... it will seep into the cracks in her shell and she will turn to rot... her purpose will spoil and disintegrate. She will be subsumed into the roiling pit of darkness, with only virulent regret and pain burned eternally into her dimming mind.

She can hear the Dust all around her. She can feel its potential in every particle of matter. The noise grows, and grows, and grows, and grows, growing, growing, growing --

$N$: Um... I... I think it’s the Glandilock Seed...
__c2 $EB$: What’s a Glandilock Seed?
$N$: I received it when I was born... it connects me to The Center and gives me the power to transform Dust Crystals into Cards.
$N$: The Glandilock Seed holds close the memories of what I have seen. It reminds me of what the Dust is capable of. It reminds me of the stakes of my mission. Thanks to the Glandilock Seed... I will never lose focus on what truly matters: eradicating the Dust.
__c2 $EB$: Nova...
__c2 $EB$: Sweetheart...
__c2 $EB$: In this life... many things will happen that might hurt or scare us. Sometimes, yes, we’ll learn and grow and continue on our journey. But sometimes, Nova...
__c2 $EB$: Sometimes things are just bad... There’s not always a lesson. When you were young, you saw things that scared you. You were pressured with the weight of unfair expectations...
$N$: ...
__c2 $EB$: Does the Glandilock Seed help you to understand the true nature of your fears? Does it lift you up when you reach for something more beautiful and true within yourself? Or does it wield your fears against you, beating you down with insecurity until you believe you have no choice?

$N$: That’s why I can’t be the one to turn against The Center. I can’t be the one to end this. No matter what I might think or feel.
__c2 $EB$: Nova... when you were born, they called you the Nano Cleaner. But you were the one who rose to that mantle. You were the one who molded yourself into the person who has made it this far.
__c2 $EB$: And now... isn’t it time to form yourself once again? Isn’t it time to take that power of adaptation, and redirect it towards what you truly believe? As long as you are alive, Nova, that is your gift. You can always become something new.

$N$: I don’t know Elegy... I just don’t know if I can believe that... I don’t think it’s right for me to gamble on a chance like that...

FATUM NOVAE: ARMOR OF DESTINY\nPRESS ANY BUTTON TO START
1. Once, there was a mighty king named Erythros who ruled New Theeland with wisdom and strength. Beneath his steady hand the kingdom prospered, and he was loved by all.
2. One day, the fearsome dragon Lord $Dustdra awoke from his ancient slumber. From the mouth of his cavern, he surveyed the kingdom and grew jealous of its happiness and wealth.
3. Lord $Dustdra flew to the castle and lay seige to it. Many brave knights set out to slay Lord $Dustdra, but all of them perished. Grieved by the suffering of his people, King Erythros donned the Armor of Destiny and set out to face the dragon.
4. King Erythros swung the Sword of Purity at Lord $Dustdra. The magical blade struck true and cleaved the dragon’s nigh-impermeable scales.
5. Blow after blow King Erythros lay upon the dragon. But Lord $Dustdra was cunning. He aimed for the Armor of Destiny with his massive claws, swiping away the breastplate, boots, and shield.
6. With Erythros thus disarmed, Lord $Dustdra at last slew the king with a final burst of flame. Weakened but victorious, Lord $Dustdra flew back to his cavern, clutching the Armor of Destiny.
7. After the battle, Prince Leuko, the heir to the throne, fell under a mysterious curse and turned to stone.
8. With no king to guide them, the kingdom fell into darkness, awaiting the day foretold when the Prince Leuko, the White Bloodcell, would return to bring peace and prosperity back to New Theeland...

Indecisive Adventurer: W-why is this path still going? Was it meant to be closed off, but accidentally left open? What if there is nothing at the end? Surely no one would intentionally create such a boring path... time to turn back.
Indecisive Adventurer: (Wait...)
Indecisive Adventurer: (W-What if it's the Sword of Purity??)
Indecisive Adventurer: Should I turn back, Nova? It’s so cold... and perhaps this path will never end... Once upon a time, I believed in truth and justice... I thought that hard work would be rewarded! But the real world isn’t like that, is it, Nova? We are all just made of tiny particles, spinning in chaos. The universe cares not for our feeble attempts to contain its infinite dance. Each of us, a universe... each of us, an atom. Change the factor of scale just a little bit, and suddenly every problem ceases to have meaning. How do we respond to everything at once? How is a story anything but a lie? Does it matter?

Candy corn and corn syrup candy! I scarfed it all down until I couldn’t hold another bite! The next thing I remember was waking up here in this cauldron...
Pilar Treacl: Someone must be cooking me for dinner! I feel my body melting into soup!! A fitting punishment for my own gluttony. Ah, but Nova... If you clean me of the Dust, I may be able to squeeze free of the cauldron! And I promise never again to eat another sweet for all my days!

Fukuchi: You, a living being, found me! Now, I can find my way on to the afterlife.
Fukuchi: But, with how this world works... I may not be able to connect with my friends ever again. Whether I blame myself for leaving, or some greater force for putting me on that island, it makes no difference. The system makes no exceptions.
Fukuchi: Living on that island, I remembered airplanes, trains, cars. Cities, farms, wars. What would it be like to live out my life with things like that? I had to find out! I had to leave! I had to experience something more than the island.

Thanks to Stavros, I have learned to live here in the desert. There is never any need to yearn for what I have lost.

ST: For many years, I lived alone here in the Desert. Yes, hm. When the sun was at its peak, I would sleep in the shadows of a stony shelf. In the dimming hours, I would travel the dunes, cataloguing the qualities of foliage and rock across the sands of outer New Theland.
ST: Some people assume that the desert is defined by undifferentiated monotony... “just sand”, so to speak. --Not so! The life patterns of the beasts and shrubberies, the fluctuations in wind and moisture, even the microscopic workings of the Nano Dust are writ upon these sands like an illuminated manuscript!
ST: Ah, but my quiet life of observation was turned on its head when Gravis fell from the stars. I found them, grasping at life, cradled in the deep, hemispherical crater of their impact. My days took on a stunning immediacy as I cared for this beautiful and fascinating soul. They lit a spark within me... made me feel fluid, shifting, alive.

He is all the more beautiful for having been broken and reformed!
GR: On the other hand... the process of decay seems to be accelerating, lately. We fear that one day we will not be able to keep up with the repairs... that one day Loquat will crumble down completely and be scattered into the desert sands, never to be seen again.

NI: I myself, have suffered from a bit of amnesia! Or, perhaps not, it is hard to say... all I know is that one day, I awoke on the shores of this beach, salt-soaked and bedraggled. Was that the beginning of my life?
NI: I have always been subject to sudden bouts of fainting, during which I would experience the most peculiar dreams. I heard a voice commanding me: “Do not create The Boht! The Boht is forbidden! The Boht shall be our downfall!”

NI: I became obsessed! “What is The Boht?” I would wonder. I began to carry a journal with me so that I could record my speculations, and I pressed the voice for further information.
[FADE]
“Venerated dream voice,” I said. “If it would please you, explain to me the qualities of The Boht, lest I create it accidentally, out of ignorance.”
“Ah... fair point,” replied the voice. “This, you must never create: an oblong vessel, curved along the bottom, of size and strength enough to carry passengers upon its top surface. Thank you for your vigilance against The Boht.”
[CLEAR]
And so, my days would pass. Slowly, I pieced together a finer and finer understanding of The Boht from the admonitions of the voice:
“...Certainly, make no such shape as has a wide surface area with hollow interior!”
“...Beware of hanging a large cloth from any tall poles which may rise from the center of your object!”
“...Seek not to bring the front side of your creation to tapered point, lest it cut through its surrounding medium with great efficiency!”
[CLEAR]
I began to create many different models of The Boht, which now form the infrastructure of the town of Import! And yet... as proud as I am of all of my work, I still feel a bit hollow. Why was the dream voice so concerned about these mundane--if beautiful--structures? What is the true meaning of The Boht?
[FADEOFF]

Crustacia:n This beach looks out onto the Substratian Sea. It is said that The Center grew New Theland from out of the waters. What was The Center doing before then? Ah... such questions have no answer.
Crustacia:n Nowan is quite concerned with the true meaning of The Boht, but I am content to have a place to call my own. Is there really such a thing as a “true meaning”?
Crustacia:n I find it quite comforting to look out at the sea, because it reminds me that the world is finite. “Ahhh... this is where it all ends.” I think to myself. “How reassuring.”

A raft is a very convenient way to get around! However, it is said only one with the power of the "Vacuum" can use its sucking ability to quickly sail.
Only the one with the Vacuum can use its suction to swiftly sail through the Pastel Horizon.

Peasant: Hi, Nova! I see you somehow conveniently have a map of New Theeland! Are you wondering why you can't see where you are on it? Well... it's a map, that's why! Ha ha. It's okay, though. Just look for landmarks to figure out where you are!
