CP2:n Some say that life is a circle... Madness! All things grow from a point - a center. Everything to come was already here: it melts out from a tiny capsule, like a sponge in bloom. 
CP2:n The beauty is to witness the true shape of the primordial point, its fractals unfurled to their limits. The atomic, indivisible tips of its tentacles. Time, after all, is a looking glass. An illusion, and yet, the truest way to see our self.

Ah, yes, this voice! So fragrant, so beautiful, that Nova felt like crying. (Had she been blessed with tear ducts, perhaps she would have.)
You may have forgotten how hard it is when you first realize that you exist. Nova certainly felt that now. But when she heard this creature speak... she thought... perhaps it might be worth it.

CP: Space, after all, is an illusion. It could be likened to... a looking glass.

Reguloid: Woof wo-woof! (Translation: Temperature: 36 degrees yolkenheit)

Reguloid: Wo-wo woof-woofer! (Translation: Golden summer light, dappled by oak leaves. The scent of freshly-bruised crabgrass and dandelions. An unexpected cool breeze drifts in from across the lake. A tawny rabbit sits up and sniffs before hopping into the bushes.)

Cozy Yolcrobe: Hmm, yes, yes, yes... a little Cereal, a little Yolkmilk, yes. Such things are quite necessary. However, as the old saying goes, "Glandilock Seed cannot live on ingestion alone"! 

Cozy Yolcrobe: Ahh, yes, yes indeed. It is time for you to have Reguloids of your very own! How beautiful, to become a home. May your head always be a safe and warm resting place for the precious Glandilock Seed. Yes, yes, yes.

PAL: There you are, darling hatchling, I knew you could make it! Welcome to Alive!

[CUT TO cutscenevc]
PAL: Nova, you are in Center Sanctuary, the dwelling place of The Center! The Center is… well, it’s hard to explain to someone who’s only just hatched, isn’t it? The Center is the center... it created all of us, along with our world: the island of New Theland. The Center is like an artist, and we are its painting, a beautiful expression of its vision!
CP: The Center is everything. Or rather, The Center simply Is. Our lives are like shadows cast by The Center's true form, which will one day become apparent.
// 4
[CUT TO palvc]
PAL: Hmm... perhaps we are all the artists and art of New Theland. We shape and are shaped by each other... by treating our neighbors with kindness, we can build each other up.

[CUT TO cpvc]
CP: Erm... well... I don't know if I would go that far, Palisade... what good we may accomplish flows directly from the rightness of The Center. Regardless, we must focus.
CP: Nova, listen closely. I will now reveal to you your true purpose and the path ahead.
CP: You have been born into a war zone, Nova. Granted, it is not a contest of swords or guns, of armies or infantry... we wage a war that is nearly invisible and yet wholly insidious... we face a deadly force that wrinkles the face of time, as a lurking waterbeast ripples the surface of a lake, disrupting the clear reflection of our souls.
CP: We call it Nano Dust...
// 11
//<Maybe a musical change? Some scary dust themed music that plays when nova sees uncomfortable dust-related stuff, or has flashbacks>
//<illustrations>
CP: It starts small, a microscopic seed planted in some dark, moist corner of one's organs. Then the Nano Dust grows, it feeds upon the structure of our minds, magnifying our fears, our wrath, our wrongful desires. Eventually it blossoms to its full scale, completely obliterating the identity of its host.
CP: Symmetry, beautiful symmetry, is our birthright as creations of The Center, and yet we lose ourselves in the Dust. We begin to decay. To Decompose. To crumble. Dust begets dust, and we forsake our true selves.
//13 <Hopeful/worshipful music? or maybe just the harp music>
CP: Nova, perhaps your true purpose is now becoming apparent. You were given the abilities to shrink and to clean so that you might reverse the tide of Dust that threatens to overwhelm us.  You must travel far and wide, shrinking inside the inhabitants of New Theland, those most consumed by the Dust's contamination. You--

// storm damage, shields lower
PAL: But alas! Before you were born, the Dust Prism was damaged in a terrible storm, and now it can only contain a small fraction of its full #Dust capacity! Because of this energy shortage, the #Dust's dominion has advanced to the point where it is no longer safe to leave the city! You can see the storm still raging overhead...
// level up prism with cards, card anim
PAL: This is where you come in, Nova! The Dust Prism can be reinforced with rare and powerful Cards that you can find while Nano Cleaning. Your first goal is to reinforce the Prism with 4 Cards and fill it with 100cc Nano Dust. Then The Center will be able to recycle the #Dust into energy and push back the storm, allowing you to leave Center City Cenote!

PAL: The Dust Prism allows the Nano Dust you collect to blossom safely. Once it has blossomed, the clouds of #Dust can be recycled into energy by the Center. 
PAL: Unfortunately, the Dust Prism was weakened by a great storm and cannot hold its full capacity of Nano Dust. That was before your time, little munchkin. Please collect rare Cards to reinforce the Dust Prism!

PAL: Amazing, Nova! You've reinforced the Prism with Cards, and deposited enough Dust to clear the storm! Also, your canister can now hold 90 units!
CP: Nano Cleaner Nova, you bring this fallen world ever closer to its most perfect state—an unadulterated connection with its own identity, with its own Center.

C Psalmist sings: 
"Blessed are they who walk along the path of their creation, who radiate cleanliness from The Center, as light is cast from a flame."
"The fool says, 'I am The Center'. They are like an arrogant flower, sprouting early to mock the winter’s cold. The wicked shall wither before they blossom, their machinations crumbling to Dust." 
"But the righteous bloom in season, the work of their hands is blessed. Their radiance is a joy to the ones they love, their leaves a comfort and a shade."

PAL: Do you remember when that Nano creature attacked you after you were just born? I channeled the power of a Card then to create an invincible barrier. Nova, I’d like you to have my Card now! Keep it close, and don’t use it to reinforce the Prism. May it protect you from all harm, even when I am far away...
(Nova received the Palisade Card!)

$TG$: When I was young, Nova, the world was bright and delicious. I loved nothing more than to eat and taste and be satisfied. But as I grew, the magic of my tongue began to fade. Food felt like sand upon my tongue, life became dull and gray.
Then... the $Dust came! I could feel its writhing, unruly power growing inside of me. My sense of taste returned, more vibrant than ever before! Red bumps slowly began to appear upon my skin, but I ignored them, delighting in the wonderful flavors the world had to offer!

[FADE]
The heaving beast, Bran Maligden, screams at Nova, but screaming is not enough. She stomps the platform and pounds her fists, rattling the skeletal structure around her. 
Nova stands frozen in terror. Is she going about this "Nano Cleaning" business all wrong? Nova feels ashamed for making Bran so angry, for not approaching more tactfully. She wonders if maybe The Center was wrong to trust her with such an important task...
Suddenly... CRASH!!!
[CLEAR]
A slab of concrete falls from above, breaking into pieces across the creature’s head.
“You think that's pretty funny, don't you?!!” Bran screams. “DING DONG the Wicked Witch is CRUSHED"!! AHAHAH!! I got what I deserved, THAT's what you're thinking!!”
Nova cannot imagine anything less funny than Bran Maligden's pain. But maybe Bran can see something about Nova that she herself cannot. Perhaps there is an ugliness inside of Nova that she has not yet learned to recognize...
"I need help..." Bran Maligden says, suddenly, quietly. "Please... clean me."

$RP$: Where did the anger begin? It's impossible to say. But if the $Dust had not arrived, I would never have reached this point, drowning in my own rage. Like a soft buzzing sound or a faint red light, slowly growing in intensity, I was hardly aware of what was happening until it was too late. Then I felt like there was nothing I could do but scream and shake.
I became so foul and ugly in my rage. Thank you, Nova, for helping me to find peace.

Nova turns to see Misteria Waizel's head rise from beneath the bedcovers. The weary figure continues to expel harsh wet coughs. Nova bows her head in shame and glances around frantically. It is difficult to say what mess she may have caused, so she begins to shuffle about, attempting to tidy the room generally.
"Stop touching my lampshade collection!" Misteria Waizel snaps. "Come over here, I need to talk to you."

MC: Do you like lampshades? ... COUGH... hrk... Some of these lampshades are worth a lot of money! But who cares about money?! COUGH! It's all about the artistry! You see that one? Don't touch it with your grubby little fingers! That was my grandmother's lampshade. See the exquisite lace patterning around the brim? COUGH COUGH...
MC: COUGH COUGH... It's good to meet a fellow lampshade buff. You really do like lampshades, don't you? COUGH... Thinking of taking one for yourself while I'm not looking, are you? Who would notice or care if you took advantage of a miserable, weak old coot? That's what you're thinking, aren't you?! COUGH... gurgle...
MC: They don't make lampshades like these anymore. COUGH... hrk...
MC: You wouldn't know. You are young and strong, and you think that you'll live forever. But eventually things fall apart and people leave you and they kick your shins on their way out. They steal your lampshades. COUGH COUGH... I can't even remember anymore, all the lampshades that are gone. Out of sight, out of mind. What is in sight anymore for me...?
MC: I've got a good feeling about you. COUGH... hrk... I need you to do something for me. Please clean the Dust from my lungs. COUGH... What, do you need a lampshade in return or something?!

Nova. You've done a good thing here. My lungs are much better now. Maybe I'll be able to finish writing my lampshade book now. Did you ever clean up the dirt you tracked into my bedroom? You know, $The Center itself once sent me a special lampshade, with unbelievable symmetry, in recognition of my work cataloguing and appreciating lampshades.
[CLEAR]
Thank you, Nova. I really appreciate what you've done here. I mean it sincerely. You can have any lampshade you like. Well, as long as it's the Retro Frill model in mint green. I've already got one of those, see? Thank you, Nova. Goodbye.

The great squirming creature hangs its head, and speaks in a low rumble. "Ohhh... the mud feels cool and calming to our skin, prickled as we are by fever and eczema."
In this dark and still corner of the alleys, Nova hears the soft squishing sounds of the Gwoms writhing and turning. She shivers at the faint groans that they emit while pressing their delicate pink skins into the muck.

Now, the Great Gwom lifts its head and stares off at an imaginary horizon, tears glistening in the corners of her eyes. “I hear a distant echo from the past... the shadow of a misremembered song," she says, slowly growing in intensity. “We Gwoms were once proud and beautiful!” she proclaims, “Or else... The Center would never have created us!!”
The Great Gwom turns to Nova and says, “It is the Dust! The Dust has caused us to forget ourselves, and now all we have left is to ease our discomfort by rolling in the filth... Please, Nano Cleaner Nova! Clean us, so we may understand The Center’s plan once again!”

[FADE]
After a long ride to the top of Cenote, Nova exits the elevator and steps onto a wide, circular platform, built from white material she saw in Cenote. To the north and south are two big bridges. Instinctually, she picks the northern bridge, and crosses it.
Urban sounds fade away, leaving a gentle breeze and rustling grass. Hills and mountains of deep blue fill the horizon, pulling her attention in all directions. It feels... different.
Gazing at these sights, Nova can't help but feel a strange feeling deep inside her chest, something almost pulling her downward, easing her senses into the blue soil. Was this peace? Happiness?
[CLEAR]
N... No. It couldn't be. She remembered what C Psalmist had told her. Though the blue sky and distant mountains appeared calm and inviting, Nova knew that the stillness in the air was deceiving - a trick. It was merely a facade, as somewhere out here, Nano Dust was growing. Threatening to consume the world.
Her new feeling - it must be a new kind of fear.
Right?
There's no time to relax - Nova knows this. She must work. She must clean. She must seek out every infected person in these mountains and protect them...
[CLEAR]

This ends the preview version of Anodyne 2: Return to Dust. Thank you so much for taking the time to play and support us, it means a lot, especially that you got to the end... Marina and I (Sean) have been working so hard. We hope you enjoyed it.

Dolphfan:n Oh, uh... see that egg thing over to my right? You can "Save Your Game" with it.  Also, in the Pause Menu, you can read about the items and cards you have! The map also marks your position.
Dolphfan:n Well, I ran out of useful tips, so here's a life tip: don't toast your bread! Try microwaving it for 10 seconds. Life will never be the same.

scene elevator-tip
Jellyvator:n Oh... oh ho ho ho. Are you... are you gonna get on the elevator? What? You don't know how? Well! See the 'down' arrow on the left side of the elevator? You can talk to it to go down to Center Sanctuary! BUT. Wait, there's more! See the UP ARROW on the right side? You can talk to it to leave Cenote and go up to the beautiful Blue Vale! That's right: this elevator goes both ways!
Jellyvator:n I'm forbidden to step foot into Center Sanctuary or head out of Cenote, but I'll be watching you the whole way, whether you're goin' in or out. I've got no preference. I just love elevators.
Jellyvator:n By the way, do you need an elevator pitch? I've got a bunch of them, but I can't use them... I can't ride the elevator, after all. Maybe "I'm Nova! I love to clean Nano Dust. First cleaning's on me! Shwoosh-sha!"

/Sean Han Tani: Here's your answer: it's................ delayed! Just for a little while, though. Till July, probably. 
/Sean Han Tani: But hey! That's only like, 60 days. No sweat. You should play a cool game in the meantime, like LUCAH or something.
/Sean Han Tani: Anyways, I know you believe in us. Thank you for that, truly. There are people who don't believe in what Marina and I are doing... we will prove them wrong... ha ha ha ha ha ha
