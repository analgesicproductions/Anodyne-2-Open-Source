A thorough development history would take too long to write, but here's a brief outline, followed by our inspirations.

My thoughts on production is it went extremely well, surprisingly so given I was working part-time! 

Although little 'happened' over 2017-08 to 12, I think those were important to let the initial ideas of the game stew. Pre-production was relatively short because 3D was very simple and 2D was relying on experience with Anodyne 1's 2D.

Length
* Blue Skies Ideation: 1-2 Weeks + 3-4 Months rest
* Focused Ideation/Plotting: ~1 Month
* Prototyping, Main Story: ~3 Months (some overlap with pre-prod)
* Pre-Production, Main Story: ~4 Months (some overlap with prod)
* Production: ~11 Months
* Bugtesting: ~1 Month (split over multiple phases: Halfway thru production, then end of production)
* Console release lagged behind main release by 1.5 years


# Rough Development Timeline

## Notes
* Main story dialogue was generally done first, followed by the specific areas. The lag time between specific area dialogue (e.g. Geof) and the implementation in-game was much smaller (days to weeks) than that of the main story I think.
* I don't specify it but usually the music for an area was done a while after finishing that area and having some of the art

## November 2016-July 2017
* After Even the Ocean dev
* Hiatus (Melos teaching, working on All Our Asias)
## 2017/08

* Marina Character sketches
## 2017/10
* Melos makes some Unity intro material for Marina
## 2017/12
* At some point Marina makes a 2D platformer prototype where you swap between three sizes
* Ideation, but more focused. Multiple sizes ideas. Story ideas (based on "Ano1 mythology"), "New Theland", world structure (concentric rings)
## Q1 2018
* Structure of game decided, most plot points, dust carrying mechanics
* Ideation -> Prototyping phase.
* Melos ports some All Our Asias code over. Preliminary 2D/3D infrastructure, dialogue, etc.
* Work is still pretty part-time on the game.
* Initial story writing?

## Q2 2018
* 3D Area prototyping (much of what you see in postgame), camera code, movement code, CCC prototypes, making Dust Drops work, other misc stuff (Albumenium)
* Prototyping -> Pre-production

* Occasional localization programming for Chinese, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, as console port progresses

## 2020 Q1
* Sephonie Pre-production
* Spanish, Japanese

* Finishing Japanese

## 2020 Q3
* Russian, Chinese/Japanese fixes
* Content locked for Consoles
## 2021 Q1
* Finish Russian
* Console release in February 2021

## Ways we saved time
* Limit scripted cutscenes
* Use Floating characters (Palisade/C Psalmist)
* Limit levels to 2 or so new entities to save coding time
* Use visual-novel style scenes sometimes
* Avoid too much 3D levels to save modeling time
* Avoid complex 3D art maps
* Avoid re-doing much/graphical polish
* Use 2D gameplay which we've done before
* Use Unity for efficient everything
## Cut Ideas 
* Walking away from 3d npcs to end the dialogue
* Dreams, sleeping, another character, Roselle, presumably would parallel Briar (I think this became the Glandilock?)
* Roselle arcade and crazy visual novel interface thing
* 3D Dustbound
* Cut this heatmap with settable icons, path drawing, reference colors, used for more complex 3D Exploration
